# RITK Gap Audit — ITK / SimpleITK / ANTs / Grassroots DICOM Comparison

**Sprint 98 (2026):** GAP-98 closes the `ritk-snap` DICOMDIR viewer import slice. Added `crates/ritk-snap/src/dicom/input_path.rs` as the viewer-domain SSOT for classifying DICOM directories, selected `DICOMDIR` files, and other files. Startup path handling, series scanning, and DICOM loading now normalize a `DICOMDIR` file to its parent root before delegating to `ritk-io`, and the File menu now exposes an explicit Open DICOMDIR command. Residual viewer gaps remain hanging protocol/state persistence, segmentation label editing, and broader workflow parity; codec residuals remain JPEG-LS/JPEG 2000/JPEG XL native replacement/optionalization.

**Sprint 97 (2026):** GAP-97 closes the `ritk-snap` richer metadata/tag inspection slice. Added `crates/ritk-snap/src/dicom/metadata_table.rs` as a presentation-neutral SSOT for DICOM tag rows and updated the sidebar Tags panel to render that deterministic row model. The inspector now covers series identifiers, patient/study fields, dimensions, spacing, origin, direction, bit-depth, photometric interpretation, first-slice SOP/geometry/display/transfer-syntax fields, private scalar tags, preserved object-model nodes, and raw preserved element byte counts. README now documents the `ritk-snap` crate tree and viewer capability. Residual viewer gaps remain DICOMDIR import, hanging protocol/state persistence, segmentation label editing, and broader workflow parity; codec residuals remain JPEG-LS/JPEG 2000/JPEG XL native replacement/optionalization.

**Sprint 96 (2026):** GAP-96 advances `ritk-snap` DICOM viewer startup workflow. Added `AppLaunchOptions` and `run_app_with_options()` in the viewer core boundary, added `SnapApp::with_initial_path()` to queue first-frame loading and pre-scan DICOM directories into the series browser, and added `ritk-snap [PATH]` CLI parsing in the binary. Validation also corrected current API drift in the series-browser adapter, CLI DICOM viewer command, Python statistics binding, segmentation exports, and `ritk-model` affine tests. `cargo test --workspace` was attempted and timed out after 15 minutes, so closure is based on package-level gates plus workspace example verification. Residual viewer gaps remain DICOMDIR import, hanging protocol/state persistence, segmentation label editing, richer metadata/tag inspection, and continued codec replacement for JPEG-LS/JPEG 2000/JPEG XL.

**Sprint 95 (2026):** GAP-95 makes external DICOM codec fallback ownership explicit in the transfer-syntax SSOT. `TransferSyntaxKind::is_external_backend_codec_candidate()` now classifies encapsulated syntaxes not implemented by RITK-native codecs, and `DicomRsBackend` uses that predicate for fallback dispatch. Predicate tests prove JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XL remain external fallback surfaces while JPEG Baseline/Extended/Lossless and RLE Lossless remain native-owned. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 94 (2026):** GAP-94 decouples the validated native pixel path from the legacy unchecked compatibility function. `decode_native_pixel_bytes_checked()` now delegates to a private unchecked primitive only after validating pixel representation, rescale finiteness, and expected frame byte length. The public `decode_native_pixel_bytes()` symbol remains for compatibility and is deprecated with migration guidance. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 93 (2026):** GAP-93 validates modality LUT finiteness at the `ritk-dicom` pixel SSOT. `PixelLayout::validate_rescale_parameters()` now rejects non-finite `rescale_slope` and `rescale_intercept`; `decode_native_pixel_bytes_checked()` and native JPEG L16 decode call it before applying `sample * slope + intercept`. Added negative tests for NaN slope and infinite intercept. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 92 (2026):** GAP-92 validates native DICOM `PixelRepresentation` metadata at the `ritk-dicom` pixel SSOT. `PixelLayout::validate_pixel_representation()` now accepts only DICOM-valid values `0` (unsigned) and `1` (signed). `decode_native_pixel_bytes_checked()` and native JPEG L16 decode call this validation before interpreting samples, preventing invalid values from being silently treated as unsigned. Added a value-semantic negative test for invalid metadata. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 91 (2026):** GAP-91 completes the checked native pixel byte contract for byte-addressable integer samples. `decode_native_pixel_bytes` now decodes 24-bit unsigned samples as `u24`, 24-bit signed samples through explicit sign extension, 32-bit unsigned samples as `u32`, and 32-bit signed samples as `i32` before applying the modality LUT. Added value-semantic tests for signed 24-bit and signed/unsigned 32-bit native sample decode. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 90 (2026):** GAP-90 adds an exact native pixel byte-length contract. `PixelLayout` now exposes `samples_per_frame()` and `bytes_per_frame()`, and `decode_native_pixel_bytes_checked()` rejects byte slices whose length differs from the expected DICOM frame byte length. RLE Lossless, native JPEG L8, uncompressed DICOM pixel decode, and `dicom-rs` fallback bytes now route through the checked decoder. This prevents extra 8-bit bytes from producing extra output samples and prevents odd/trailing 16-bit bytes from being silently dropped by `chunks_exact`. Added a value-semantic negative test for trailing bytes. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 89 (2026):** GAP-89 tightens native codec backend correctness. `NativeCodecBackend` now checks transfer-syntax support before reading encapsulated frame bytes, so unsupported native syntaxes fail without touching pixel data. RLE Lossless header parsing now uses a checked `read_u32_le` helper instead of production `try_into().unwrap()`, preserving contextual errors. Added a test fixture whose `encapsulated_frame` always errors to prove unsupported syntax rejection does not read pixel data. Residual DICOM codec gaps remain JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 88 (2026):** GAP-88 separates native codec dispatch from the `dicom-rs` fallback adapter. Added `backend/native.rs` with `NativeCodecBackend`, which implements `FrameDecodeBackend<O>` for any `O: EncapsulatedFrameSource` and owns RLE Lossless plus native JPEG transfer syntaxes. `DicomRsBackend` now delegates RITK-owned codecs to `NativeCodecBackend` and retains responsibility for `DefaultDicomObject` access plus fallback through `dicom_pixeldata::PixelDecoder`. Added tests using a small `EncapsulatedFrameSource` fixture so native backend behavior is verified without constructing a `dicom-rs` object. Residual DICOM codec gaps: JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 87 (2026):** GAP-87 extends native Rust JPEG dispatch to JPEG Lossless Non-Hierarchical (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57) and JPEG Lossless First-Order Prediction (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70). `TransferSyntaxKind::is_native_jpeg_codec()` is now the single predicate for RITK-owned JPEG transfer syntaxes, and `DicomRsBackend` uses that predicate before falling back to `dicom-rs`. Added an exact-value test for a hand-constructed 1x1 lossless Huffman JPEG stream; the decoded sample and modality LUT result are asserted directly. Residual DICOM codec gaps: JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, broader color/high-bit-depth JPEG validation, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 86 (2026):** GAP-86 starts the native JPEG replacement path inside `ritk-dicom`. Added `codec/native/jpeg.rs` using Rust `jpeg-decoder` behind the RITK pixel contract. JPEG Baseline and JPEG Extended now attempt native grayscale L8/L16 decode first, validate decoded dimensions and byte length against `PixelLayout`, apply the canonical modality LUT, and fall back to `dicom-rs` when the native path rejects unsupported JPEG color/high-bit-depth variants. `TransferSyntaxKind::is_native_ritk_codec()` now includes JPEG Baseline/Extended and RLE Lossless. Residual DICOM codec gaps: full JPEG Lossless coverage, JPEG-LS replacement, JPEG 2000 replacement/optionalization, JPEG XL replacement/optionalization, and automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 85 (2026):** GAP-85 closed the transfer-syntax migration. `ritk-dicom::TransferSyntaxKind` now owns all compatibility predicates required by `ritk-io`: `is_compressed`, `is_codec_supported`, `is_natively_supported`, `is_big_endian`, and `is_lossless`. `reader.rs` and `multiframe.rs` now import `ritk_dicom::TransferSyntaxKind` directly. `crates/ritk-io/src/format/dicom/transfer_syntax.rs` is reduced to a compatibility re-export with tests, preserving `ritk_io::TransferSyntaxKind` while eliminating duplicate enum logic. README now lists `ritk-dicom` and current Python binding counts. Verification: `cargo check -p ritk-dicom`; `cargo test -p ritk-dicom`; `cargo check -p ritk-io`; `cargo test -p ritk-io transfer_syntax`; targeted RLE consumer test with UCRT64 first on `PATH`. Residual DICOM gaps: JPEG Baseline/Extended native decoder replacement; JPEG-LS C++ dependency replacement or optionalization; JPEG 2000 C dependency optionalization/replacement; automatic Windows GNU runtime PATH handling.

**Sprint 84 (2026):** GAP-84 closed the first `ritk-dicom` extraction increment. Added `crates/ritk-dicom` as the Rust-owned DICOM boundary with `TransferSyntaxKind`, `PixelLayout`, native byte decode, PackBits decode, native DICOM RLE Lossless fragment decode, generic `FrameDecodeBackend<O>`, and `DicomRsBackend`. The crate now uses an SRP file tree: `backend/dicom_rs.rs`, `codec/native/packbits.rs`, `codec/native/rle.rs`, `pixel/mod.rs`, and `syntax/mod.rs`. `ritk-io::format::dicom::codec::decode_compressed_frame` now delegates through the backend trait, keeping `dicom-rs` as a replaceable backend while preserving the existing public `ritk-io` series API. `.cargo/config.toml` now forces Windows GNU native build scripts onto UCRT clang/clang++/llvm-ar and lld while preserving developer override via `force=false`. Verification: `cargo check -p ritk-dicom` passed; `cargo test -p ritk-dicom` passed 5/5; `cargo check -p ritk-io` passed with UCRT clang/lld; targeted `ritk-io` RLE consumer test passed with `D:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` first on `PATH`. Residual DICOM gaps: migrate `ritk-io::format::dicom::transfer_syntax` callers to `ritk-dicom::TransferSyntaxKind`; replace JPEG Baseline/Extended, JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XL backend paths with Rust-owned codecs where feasible; make UCRT runtime PATH handling automatic for Windows GNU test execution.

**Sprint 83 (2026):** GAP-83-01 closed: `recursive_gaussian` in `crates/ritk-python/src/filter.rs` was the sole `#[pyfunction]` without `py.allow_threads`; added `py: Python<'_>`, Arc clone before closure, and `py.allow_threads(||{...})` wrapping. Documentation drift corrected: §3.6 Skeletonization row marked ✓ (implemented Sprint 10/28, Python Sprint 20, CLI Sprint 20, 50+ tests); §3.6 severity upgraded to Closed; §7.1 four stale remaining-gap bullets removed (transform I/O closed Sprint 8; type stubs present since Sprint 31; `py.allow_threads` now fully applied; atlas/JLF closed Sprint 8); §7.1 severity downgraded Low; §7.3 code-tree comment updated to reflect 34 filter functions and 27 segmentation functions. `cargo check -p ritk-python`: 0 errors, 0 warnings. `cargo test -p ritk-python --lib`: 10/10 passed. `ritk-python` bumped 0.12.2 → 0.12.3.

**Sprint 82 (2026):** GAP-82 closed: seven Python bindings that held the CPython GIL through multi-iteration PDE loops now release it via `py.allow_threads`. Functions fixed in `crates/ritk-python/src/segmentation.rs`: `chan_vese_segment` (up to 200 Euler iterations, Chan & Vese 2001 PDE), `geodesic_active_contour_segment` (Caselles et al. 1997 GAC PDE), `shape_detection_segment` (Sethian edge-based LS PDE), `threshold_level_set_segment` (intensity-band LS PDE), `laplacian_level_set_segment` (Laplacian-driven LS PDE). Functions fixed in `crates/ritk-python/src/statistics.rs`: `hausdorff_distance` (O(M·N) directed distance, M/N = boundary voxel counts), `mean_surface_distance` (same complexity). Pattern: clone Arc handles before `py.allow_threads(||{...})` so closures are `Send + Ungil`; all parameters are Copy scalars captured by value. Python-visible API unchanged. `cargo check -p ritk-python`: 0 errors, 0 warnings. `cargo test -p ritk-python --lib`: 10/10 passed. gap_audit §7.1 status: **Closed**.

**Sprint 61 (2026):** Three gaps closed. (1) GAP-C61-01: `load_from_series` (`reader.rs`) used `from_row_slice` on the `[rx,ry,rz, cx,cy,cz, nx,ny,nz]` layout — this is column-major and must be consumed by `from_column_slice` to produce the ITK-convention direction matrix (columns = basis vectors). Fix: changed to `from_column_slice`. Now consistent with `load_dicom_multiframe` (`multiframe.rs`). Discriminating test: coronal IOP [1,0,0, 0,0,-1] — `from_column_slice` gives dir[(2,1)]=-1,dir[(1,2)]=+1; `from_row_slice` gives the opposite. (2) GAP-C61-02: Added cross-slice IOP consistency guard in `scan_dicom_directory`; emits `tracing::warn!` when max |Δiop_component| > 1e-4; policy warn-and-continue; canonical IOP = first post-sort slice. (3) GAP-C61-03: Added cross-slice PixelSpacing consistency guard; same policy; threshold 1e-4 mm. 428/428 ritk-io tests pass (+3 from Sprint 60 baseline of 425). Residual risks: DICOM-SEG writer absent (GAP-R60-04); VTI binary-appended absent (GAP-R60-05); RT Dose/Plan readers absent (GAP-R60-06).

**Sprint 60 (2026):** DICOM slice geometry hardening. Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-C60-01: `load_from_series` (`reader.rs`) silently masked nonuniform and missing slice spacing via a single-span average `(last_z − first_z)/(N−1)`. Fix: decode frames into `Vec<Vec<f32>>`, project each `ImagePositionPatient` onto the slice normal N̂ = normalize(row × col), compute all N−1 adjacent-pair gaps, derive `nominal_spacing` = median(gaps), flag `is_nonuniform` when max relative deviation > 1% and `has_missing_slices` when any gap > 1.5 × nominal, emit `tracing::warn!` with structured fields for both conditions, resample to a uniform grid via per-pixel linear interpolation (`resample_frames_linear`), update `metadata.dimensions[2]` and `metadata.spacing[2]` to reflect the resampled geometry. (2) GAP-C60-02: `scan_dicom_directory` sorted slices by raw `IPP[2]` (LPS z-component); for coronal, sagittal, and oblique acquisitions this produces an incorrect order. Fix: compute `maybe_normal` from the first IOP-bearing slice via `slice_normal_from_iop`; sort by `dot_3d(IPP, N̂)`; fall back to `IPP[2]` when IOP is absent. (3) GAP-C60-03: `scan_dicom_directory` spacing derivation replaced by `analyze_slice_spacing(&positions).nominal_spacing` (median of adjacent-pair gaps instead of single-span average). (4) GAP-C60-04: `load_dicom_multiframe` (`multiframe.rs`) used the global `SliceThickness` tag unconditionally even when `per_frame` carries accurate per-frame `image_position` values. Fix: when `per_frame.len() >= 2` and all frames carry `image_position`, project onto N̂, call `analyze_slice_spacing`, emit structured warnings, resample via `resample_frames_linear` when nonuniform or missing frames are detected; fall back to `frame_thickness` otherwise. New `pub(super)` geometry utilities added to `reader.rs`: `normalize_3d`, `dot_3d`, `slice_normal_from_iop`, `SliceGeometryReport`, `analyze_slice_spacing`, `resample_frames_linear`, constants `NONUNIFORM_SPACING_THRESHOLD = 0.01` and `MISSING_SLICE_GAP_FACTOR = 1.5`. 425/425 ritk-io tests pass (+10 from Sprint 59 baseline of 415). Residual risks: IOP consistency across slices not validated (GAP-R60-01); PixelSpacing consistency across slices not validated (GAP-R60-02); direction matrix construction inconsistency between series and multiframe readers — `load_dicom_multiframe` uses `from_column_slice`, `load_from_series` uses `from_row_slice` for the same [rx,ry,rz,cx,cy,cz,nx,ny,nz] layout, producing the transpose of each other (GAP-R60-03).


**Sprint 52 (2026-04-27):** DICOM transfer syntax correctness and UID monotonicity. (1) `generate_series_uid()` in `writer.rs` fixed: added `AtomicU64` static counter; format changed to `2.25.<ns>.<seq>` eliminating UID collision risk on Windows where SystemTime resolution is ~100 ns (symmetric with Sprint 51 fix for `generate_multiframe_uid`). (2) `ExplicitVrBigEndian` removed from `is_natively_supported()` in `TransferSyntaxKind`: `decode_pixel_bytes` always uses `u16::from_le_bytes`/`i16::from_le_bytes`; applying LE decode to BE pixel bytes produces `bswap(x)` instead of `x` — silently incorrect intensities. BigEndian DICOM is also retired per DICOM PS 3.5 (withdrawn 2004). (3) `DeflatedExplicitVrLittleEndian` removed from `is_natively_supported()`: both readers reject Deflated via `is_compressed()`; classifying it as natively supported violated the invariant `is_natively_supported() => !is_compressed()`. (4) `is_big_endian()` predicate added to `TransferSyntaxKind` returning `true` only for `ExplicitVrBigEndian`. (5) BigEndian rejection guards added to both `load_from_series` (reader.rs) and `load_dicom_multiframe` (multiframe.rs) alongside the existing `is_compressed()` checks. (6) Formal invariant `is_natively_supported() ⟹ !is_compressed() ∧ !is_big_endian()` verified by an exhaustive property test over all 11 known `TransferSyntaxKind` variants. (7) Repository hygiene: 37 scratch/temporary files removed from the repository root; `.gitignore` broadened with `*.tmp`, `*.nii`, `sizes.csv` patterns. 301/301 ritk-io unit tests pass.

**Sprint 48 (2026-04-25):** DICOM correctness hardening, DRY header extraction, and IOD conformance. (1) Compressed transfer syntax guard added to `load_dicom_multiframe` and `load_from_series`: both now detect any TS for which `TransferSyntaxKind::is_compressed()` is true and return `Err` with the TS UID before pixel decode, preventing silent garbage-intensity output on JPEG/JPEG-LS/JPEG2000/RLE files. (2) `extract_multiframe_header` private helper extracted from the duplicated header-parse blocks in `read_multiframe_info` and `load_dicom_multiframe`; both now open the file once and delegate to the shared helper. (3) `MultiFrameInfo` extended with `rescale_slope: f64` and `rescale_intercept: f64` populated from (0028,1053)/(0028,1052), exposing the linear transform without a second file open. (4) Pixel clamp `.clamp(0.0, 65535.0)` added to `write_dicom_series` and `write_dicom_series_with_metadata` per-slice encoders (both were missing it; `write_multiframe_impl` already correct). (5) `ConversionType` (0008,0064) = "WSD" added to all three writers — Type 1 mandatory in SC Equipment Module (PS3.3 C.8.6.1). (6) Five Type 2 mandatory tags added with empty/default values to `write_dicom_series`: (0008,0090) ReferringPhysicianName, (0010,0010) PatientName, (0010,0020) PatientID, (0008,0020) StudyDate, (0020,0011) SeriesNumber. Seven new value-semantic tests added. 277/277 ritk-io unit tests pass.

**Sprint 47 (2026-04-24):** DICOM IOD conformance and DRY refactor. (1)  (0028,0002) = 1 added to all three writers (, , ) — this is a Type 1 mandatory tag in the Image Pixel Module (PS3.3 C.7.6.3.1.1) that was absent from every emitted file. (2)  (0020,0013) added to the multi-frame writer via . (3) Six duplicated DS backslash-parse closures across  and  replaced by a single  generic helper (const generic encodes field width). (4)  builder struct and  added; existing  and  delegate via config construction with no public API breakage. (5) Re-export gap in  closed: , , , and  now in . Five new value-semantic tests added. 270/270 ritk-io unit tests pass.

**Sprint 47 (2026-04-24):** DICOM IOD conformance and DRY refactor. (1)  (0028,0002) = 1 added to all three writers (write_multiframe_impl, write_dicom_series, write_dicom_series_with_metadata) -- Type 1 mandatory tag in the Image Pixel Module (PS3.3 C.7.6.3.1.1) absent from every prior emitted file. (2) InstanceNumber (0020,0013) added to the multi-frame writer via MultiFrameWriterConfig.instance_number. (3) Six duplicated DS backslash-parse closures across read_multiframe_info and load_dicom_multiframe replaced by a single parse_ds_backslash generic helper parameterised by const N: usize (const generic encodes field width). (4) MultiFrameWriterConfig builder struct and write_dicom_multiframe_with_config added; existing write_dicom_multiframe and write_dicom_multiframe_with_options delegate via config construction with no public API breakage. (5) Re-export gap in format::dicom closed: MultiFrameSpatialMetadata, write_dicom_multiframe_with_options, MultiFrameWriterConfig, and write_dicom_multiframe_with_config now in pub use multiframe. Five new value-semantic tests added. 270/270 ritk-io unit tests pass.

**Sprint 46 (2026-04-24):** Three DICOM correctness bugs closed. (1) `write_dicom_multiframe` SOP class corrected from `1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.7` (Single-frame Secondary Capture) to `1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.7.3` (Multi-Frame Grayscale Word Secondary Capture). (2) `load_from_series` was silently dropping `metadata.direction` in favour of `Direction::identity()`; fixed to `Direction::from_row_slice(&metadata.direction)`. (3) The dicom-rs 0.8 `to_str()` binary-VR mis-routing bug fixed in `parse_sequence_item` (Sprint 45) was also present in the top-level `scan_dicom_directory` preservation loop; same `is_binary_vr` gate applied. New additions: `MultiFrameSpatialMetadata` struct and `write_dicom_multiframe_with_options` enable optional IPP/IOP/PixelSpacing/SliceThickness/Modality emission; `read_multiframe_info` and `load_dicom_multiframe` now parse and apply IPP/IOP. Private-tag general series round-trip closed by `test_scan_preserves_private_text_and_bytes_through_write_read_cycle`. 265/265 ritk-io unit tests pass.

**Sprint 45 (2026-04-24):** Transfer syntax UID bug fixed (`scan_dicom_directory` was reading Manufacturer tag instead of file meta). Binary VR preservation in `parse_sequence_item` fixed (OB/OW/OD/OF/OL/UN elements now stored as `DicomValue::Bytes`). Three value-semantic round-trip tests added (spatial fields, rescale params, transfer syntax). GAP-R02b closed (InverseConsistentDiffeomorphicDemonsRegistration and MultiResDemonsRegistration confirmed implemented and Python-exposed).

**Sprint 44 (2026-04-24):** DICOM multi-frame reader hardening adds value-semantic coverage for `read_multiframe_info` and `load_dicom_multiframe`. The new tests write a real multi-frame file, then verify exact frame count, dimensions, modality, SOP Class UID, and analytical pixel reconstruction bounds derived from the emitted rescale slope. Residual DICOM gaps remain in enhanced multi-frame conformance, generalized writer coverage, and broader object-model reconstruction beyond the tested private-sequence path.

**Sprint 43 (2026-04-24):** DICOM object-model reader preservation now reconstructs nested `DicomSequenceItem` content and raw private elements in `scan_dicom_directory`. The preservation path retains private SQ nodes as `DicomValue::Sequence` and raw OB payloads as `DicomPreservedElement` data, verified by a value-semantic regression test against a real DICOM file. Residual DICOM gaps remain in multi-frame / enhanced image support, generalized writer coverage, and broader object-model reconstruction beyond the tested private-sequence path.

**Sprint 43 (2026-04-24):** DICOM object-model writer hardening advances the next-stage roadmap by validating nested `DicomSequenceItem` emission and raw preserved byte retention through `ritk_io::format::dicom::writer_object`. The added tests cover SQ/OB round-trip behavior through `dicom::object::open_file`, confirming that the canonical object model preserves nested structure and private tags instead of collapsing them into scalar-only metadata. Residual risk remains in the broader DICOM surface: reader-side object-model reconstruction for arbitrary nested sequences, explicit private-tag round-trip on the general series path, multi-frame / enhanced image support, and generalized DICOM writer coverage remain open.

**Audit Date:** 2025-07-14 (updated Sprint 8, 2025-07-18; roadmap refresh 2026-04-20; Sprint 29 update 2026-04-22)**

## Update Note

**Sprint 37 (2025): ZEROCOPY-R37 replaces all redundant as_slice().to_vec() patterns with into_vec() across 15 files. Eliminates second O(N) copy; burn 0.19.1 TensorData::into_vec() transmutes Vec<u8>->Vec<f32> via bytemuck without copy when alignment matches. PERF-DG-R37 replaces Burn tensor conv1d path with direct flat-array separable convolution: convolve_separable<const D: usize> dispatches to convolve3d_dim (rayon dim-2/dim-1, serial dim-0) for D==3. DiscreteGaussian: 13.9ms->9.01ms (1.54x). GradientMagnitude: 7.1ms->6.55ms. 702/702 ritk-core tests pass. 30/30 SimpleITK parity tests pass including 4 Elastix. ZEROCOPY-ARCH-R38 (store raw ndarray in PyImage) planned for Sprint 38.**

**Sprint 36 (2025):** GAP-ELASTIX-R36 adds GAP-R08 (Elastix/ITK-Elastix Registration Interface, Severity: Medium) documenting the ElastixImageFilter/TransformixImageFilter gap: missing ASGD optimizer, parameter-map-driven interface, Transformix application path, and sparse-sampled Mattes MI. ELASTIX-PARITY-TESTS-R36 adds Section 4 (4 tests) to crates/ritk-python/tests/test_simpleitk_parity.py: test_elastix_translation_recovers_sphere_overlap, test_ritk_demons_vs_elastix_translation_quality, test_elastix_bspline_deformable_vs_ritk_syn, test_elastix_parameter_map_api_matches_expected_keys; all guarded with skipif(not _has_elastix); 56/56 tests pass. PERF-MEDIAN-R36 optimizes median_3d: Rayon z-parallelism + select_nth_unstable_by + per-z-slice Vec reuse, reducing 221ms to 14.7ms (15x speedup, now faster than SimpleITK). PERF-STATS-R36 optimizes compute_statistics: single parallel fold/reduce pass for min/max/sum/sum_sq, par_sort for percentiles. PERF-OTSU-R36 combines two O(N) min/max passes into one. PERF-GRADIENT-R36 replaces three separate Vec allocations in gradient_magnitude with a single into_par_iter pass. rayon added to ritk-core [dependencies]. Remaining slowdown vs SimpleITK in stats/otsu/gradient is dominated by Burn NdArray backend tensor extraction (clone().into_data() allocates ~1MB per call); architectural fix deferred to Sprint 37.

**Sprint 33 (2025):** PYTHON-CI-HARDENING updates `.github/workflows/python_ci.yml` so hosted runners validate the built wheel artifact rather than a local `maturin develop` install. The workflow now builds a wheel with `maturin build`, force-reinstalls `ritk` from the generated `dist/` directory, and runs both `crates/ritk-python/tests/test_python_api_parity.py` and `crates/ritk-python/tests/test_smoke.py`. The parity guard now also covers the `io` submodule by checking `crates/ritk-python/src/io.rs` registrations against `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/_ritk/io.pyi` and the `test_io_public_functions_exist` smoke-test required list. It also validates the top-level Python package contract by checking `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/__init__.py` and `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/__init__.pyi` for consistent `Image` and submodule re-exports, stable `__all__` ordering, and non-empty `__version__`, with matching smoke assertions for the installed package façade. A new helper at `crates/ritk-python/tests/python_api_drift_report.py` now prints a human-readable drift summary for Rust registrations, `.pyi` stubs, smoke-test required lists, and the top-level `ritk` package contract, so parity failures can be diagnosed without manual source inspection. Sprint artifacts were then consolidated so Sprint 32 parity work is treated as completed and the remaining open item is a single Sprint 33 hosted-runner validation entry rather than repeated deferred duplicates across prior sprint sections. This aligns Python CI with the release-wheel path already used elsewhere in the repository and narrows residual risk to hosted matrix execution, especially Windows wheel installation and environment-specific packaging behavior. Local verification remains partial: `cargo test -p ritk-python --lib -- --test-threads=4` passes, and the drift-report helper currently reports a clean state, while direct Python pytest execution is environment-blocked when `pytest` is unavailable.

**Sprint 32 (2025):** PY-API-PARITY-GUARD adds an automated Python API drift check in crates/ritk-python/tests/test_python_api_parity.py. The guard derives exported names from wrap_pyfunction! registrations in filter.rs, registration.rs, segmentation.rs, and statistics.rs, then asserts parity against the corresponding .pyi stub files and the required callable lists in test_smoke.py. Smoke coverage now spans the full registered surface for those four submodules, converting Sprint 31 manual fixes into a regression guard. Hosted-runner validation of python_ci.yml remains deferred.

**Sprint 31 (2025):** TRACING-REFACTOR-R31 eliminates all remaining = % structured-field info!() calls from segment.rs (22), convert.rs (2), resample.rs (1), stats.rs (1) — completing the workspace-wide tracing refactor started in Sprint 30. STUB-SYNC-SEG-R31 closes segmentation.pyi gaps: adds binary_fill_holes, morphological_gradient, confidence_connected_segment, neighborhood_connected_segment, skeletonization stubs (5 functions registered in segmentation.rs but missing from .pyi). SMOKE-TEST-FIX-R31 corrects 10 wrong function names in test_smoke.py across filter/segmentation/statistics. Python/CLI parity ~96%. Workspace clean: cargo check + 173/173 CLI tests pass.

**Sprint 30 (2025):** TRACING-REFACTOR eliminates ~320 rust-analyzer false-positive diagnostics across ritk-cli and ritk-io. STATS-STUB-SYNC-R30 closes statistics.pyi gap (nyul_udupa_normalize). DISCRETE-GAUSSIAN-ANALYTICAL adds impulse-response quantitative validation. Python/CLI parity now ~95%.

**Sprint 29 (2026-04-22) — Completed:** All Sprint 29 gaps closed. CLI exposure for `DiscreteGaussianFilter` (`ritk filter --filter discrete-gaussian`) and `InverseConsistentDiffeomorphicDemonsRegistration` (`ritk register --method ic-demons`) is now implemented and tested (173/173 CLI tests pass). The NIfTI sform regression guard `test_write_nifti_sets_sform_header_fields` was extracted from an incorrectly nested position and now runs as a standalone test (4/4 NIfTI tests pass). Three synthetic DICOM integration tests were added to `format::dicom::reader::tests` covering all-non-image SOP → error-with-UIDs, mixed CT+RTSTRUCT → CT retained, RT Plan+Waveform → both UIDs in error (5/5 reader tests pass). `multiframe.rs` module docs expanded with writer encoding constraints, global linear rescale limitation, spatial metadata absence, and interoperability limits. Workspace compiles clean (`cargo check --workspace --tests`, zero errors). PYTHON-CI-VALIDATION deferred to Sprint 30.

**Sprint 24 (2026-04-20):** Next-stage roadmap refreshed to prioritize DICOM object-model preservation, VTK data-model expansion, ITK/SimpleITK breadth, ITK-SNAP workflow primitives, ANTs workflow refinement, and Python parity benchmarking. Existing image-series DICOM I/O, VTK legacy image I/O, registration, and Python bindings remain as previously recorded.

`Analyze` format support is present in `crates/ritk-io/src/format/analyze/` and should be treated as implemented. This audit now focuses on the remaining imaging gaps relative to DICOM, ITK, SimpleITK, VTK, ITK-SNAP, and ANTs.

**Version**: 0.11.0 | **Date**: Sprint 79 | **Auditor**: Ryan Clanton

### Gaps closed this sprint

| Gap ID | Module | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| GAP-79-01 | Python/segmentation | `shape_detection_segment` stub default `curvature_weight` was `0.2` (copy-paste from threshold_level_set); pyo3 binding uses `1.0` matching Rust struct | Fixed `segmentation.pyi` line 83 default to `1.0` |
| GAP-79-02 | Python/packaging | `pyproject.toml` `requires-python=">=3.8"` mismatched `abi3-py39` feature | Changed to `>=3.9` |

| GAP-79-07 | Python/tests | 5 level-set binding tests asserted `np.var > 0.0` (too weak, no binary check) | Replaced with `set(unique).issubset({0.0, 1.0})` binary assertion |

### §3.3 Level Set Segmentation — Updated
- Shape Detection: Python tests now value-semantic with binary assertion (GAP-79-07) + 2 parity tests added (GAP-79-03)
- Laplacian LS: same
- Threshold LS: same
- Status: §3.3 fully closed (all 5 level-set methods have implementation + Python binding + parity tests)

### Verification status
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| stub default fix | `curvature_weight: float = 1.0` in segmentation.pyi L85 |
| pyproject requires-python | `>=3.9` |
| test_simpleitk_parity count | 54 (was 44; +10 new) |
| test_segmentation_bindings level-set | 5 tests with binary assertion |

## Sprint 77 Gap Closures

| ID | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-77-01 | Parity test files absent from `python_ci.yml` CI | Added `SimpleITK vtk` to pip install; added `test_simpleitk_parity.py`, `test_vtk_parity.py`, `test_ct_mri_registration_parity.py` to CI pytest invocation |
| GAP-77-02 | No parity test for `multires_demons_register`, `inverse_consistent_demons_register`, `compute_label_intensity_statistics` | 3 new tests added; IC-Demons sigma corrected to 1.0 (root cause: over-smoothing) |

## Sprint 63 Gap Closures

**Sprint 63 (2026):** Eight gaps closed. (1) GAP-R63-01: `BedSeparationFilter` + `BedSeparationConfig` added to `ritk-core/filter/intensity/bed_separation.rs`. Pipeline: `threshold_foreground` → `keep_largest_component` (BFS, 6-connected) → `binary_closing` → `binary_opening` → `apply_mask`. Conservative: prefer false negatives in table removal over removing anatomy. Default `body_threshold=-350.0` HU. (2) GAP-R63-02: `FilterKind` enum (`BedSeparation(BedSeparationConfig)`, `Gaussian { sigma }`, `Median { radius }`) added to `ritk-snap/src/lib.rs`. `apply_filter` method on `ViewerCore<B,3>`: concrete dispatch per arm, ownership-preserving via `take()`/restore, replaces study image in-place on success. `ModalityDisplay::for_modality`: CT→(center=-400,width=1500 HU lung window); MR→(600,1200); US→(128,256); default→(128,256). (3) GAP-R63-03: modality-aware viewer tests added (`test_modality_display_ct_window_parameters`); geometry summary invariant confirmed. (4) GAP-R63-04: `per_file_series_uids: Vec<Option<String>>` parallel vec built in `scan_dicom_directory` scan loop reading Tag(0x0020,0x000E). Series-UID grouping block after plurality-dim filter: counts per-UID, selects unique plurality UID (`series_at_max==1` guard), emits `tracing::warn!` with excluded count and selected UID, overrides `first_series_instance_uid`. Backward-compatible: tie cases (equal count) leave all slices merged as before. (5) GAP-R63-05: `write_dicom_seg` added to `seg.rs`. BINARY: MSB-first packing per DICOM PS3.5 §8.2 (`buf[base+i/8] |= 1<<(7-i%8)`) — exact inverse of `unpack_pixel_data`. FRACTIONAL: byte-per-voxel concatenation. SegmentSequence SQ with per-segment items. FileMetaTableBuilder with SEG_SOP_CLASS_UID + Explicit VR LE. (6) GAP-R63-06: `write_vti_binary_appended_bytes` + `write_vti_binary_appended_to_file` added to `image_xml/writer.rs`; `read_vti_binary_appended_bytes` + `read_vti_binary_appended` added to `image_xml/reader.rs`. Format: uint32-LE length prefix + f32-LE data per array; arrays sorted lexicographically by name for deterministic offsets; `_` marker isolates binary block from XML. (7) GAP-R63-07: `read_rt_dose` + `RtDoseGrid` in new `ritk-io/src/format/dicom/rt_dose.rs`. DoseGridScaling × u32-LE PixelData → `dose_gy: Vec<f64>`; GridFrameOffsetVector; IPP/IOP/PixelSpacing. SOP class validated: `1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.481.2`. (8) GAP-R63-08: `read_rt_plan` + `RtPlanInfo` + `RtBeamInfo` + `RtFractionGroup` in new `ritk-io/src/format/dicom/rt_plan.rs`. BeamSequence (3-level SQ) + FractionGroupSequence with ReferencedBeamSequence. SOP class: `1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.481.5`. Additional fix: `HeadlessViewerBackend::Error = std::io::Error` in `viewer.rs` (satisfies `StdError+Send+Sync+'static` bound on `ViewerBackend::Error`); `load_dicom_series` reverted to `Result<Image<B,3>>` (backward-compatible; tuple-returning variant is `load_dicom_series_with_metadata`). 445/445 ritk-io lib tests pass (+13 from Sprint 62 baseline of 432). 7/7 ritk-snap lib tests pass (+3). 177/177 ritk-cli tests pass.

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R63-01 | CT bed separation filter absent | **Closed** — Sprint 63: `BedSeparationFilter` + `BedSeparationConfig` in `ritk-core` |

| GAP-R63-08 | RT Plan reader absent | **Closed** — Sprint 63: `read_rt_plan` + `RtPlanInfo` + `RtBeamInfo` + `RtFractionGroup` in `rt_plan.rs` |

## Sprint 64 Gap Closures

**Sprint 64 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R64-01: `write_rt_dose` added to `rt_dose.rs`. Validation: `dose_gy.len ≠ n_frames·rows·cols` → bail; `frame_offsets.len ≠ n_frames` → bail; `dose_grid_scaling ≤ 0 ∨ NaN` → bail. Pixel encoding: `raw_u32[k] = round(dose_gy[k] / dose_grid_scaling).clamp(0, u32::MAX)`; LE bytes. Tags: BitsAllocated=32, BitsStored=32, HighBit=31, PixelRepresentation=0, Modality=RTDOSE. Optional spatial metadata (IPP, IOP, PixelSpacing) preserved. Round-trip invariant verified: for integer multiples of scaling, `raw_u32[k] × dose_grid_scaling = dose_gy[k]` exactly in f64. (2) GAP-R64-02: `write_rt_plan` added to `rt_plan.rs`. Emits BeamSequence (300A,00B0) SQ with per-beam tags; FractionGroupSequence (300A,0070) SQ with per-group nested ReferencedBeamSequence (300A,00B6). All plan-level strings preserved through write-read cycle. (3) GAP-R64-03: `ritk-io/src/lib.rs` expanded with 25 new public symbols: all multiframe writer variants, RT Dose/Plan reader/writer, DICOM-SEG reader/writer, RT Struct types, VTI binary-appended reader/writer. `format/vtk/image_xml/mod.rs` updated to expose 4 binary-appended functions. (4) GAP-R64-04: 5 VTI binary-appended CellData tests added across `image_xml/writer.rs` (3 tests) and `image_xml/reader.rs` (2 tests). Tests cover: CellData-only round-trip, PointData+CellData mixed round-trip, CellData offset derivation (analytically: 4+n_pd_values×4 bytes from PointData block). 454/454 ritk-io lib tests pass (+9 from Sprint 63 baseline of 445). 7/7 ritk-snap lib tests pass. 177/177 ritk-cli tests pass.

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R64-01 | RT Dose writer absent | **Closed** — Sprint 64: `write_rt_dose` in `rt_dose.rs` |
| GAP-R64-02 | RT Plan writer absent | **Closed** — Sprint 64: `write_rt_plan` in `rt_plan.rs` |
| GAP-R64-03 | New DICOM/VTI types not in ritk-io crate-level pub-use | **Closed** — Sprint 64: `lib.rs` + `image_xml/mod.rs` updated |
| GAP-R64-04 | VTI binary-appended CellData path not tested | **Closed** — Sprint 64: 5 new CellData binary-appended tests |

## Sprint 65 Gap Closures

**Sprint 65 (2026):** Five gaps closed. (1) GAP-R65-01: `BinaryThreshold` struct + `binary_threshold` free function + `apply_binary_threshold_to_slice` zero-copy variant added to `crates/ritk-core/src/segmentation/threshold/binary.rs`. Invariants: `lower ≤ upper` (panic); `inside_value` and `outside_value` must be finite (panic). Default: lower=NEG_INFINITY, upper=INFINITY, inside=1.0, outside=0.0 — matches ITK `BinaryThresholdImageFilter`. Re-exported in `threshold/mod.rs` and `segmentation/mod.rs`. 21 tests added covering all boundary conditions, custom values, half-open intervals (NEG_INFINITY/INFINITY), single-point band, 3D analytical voxel count, spatial metadata preservation, struct/function parity, and panic guards. (2) GAP-R65-02: `MarkerControlledWatershed` added to `crates/ritk-core/src/segmentation/watershed/marker_controlled.rs`. Priority-queue flooding (Meyer 1994) from explicit seed markers. Algorithm: initialize min-heap from unlabeled 6-neighbors of seeds; pop in ascending gradient order; assign single neighboring label or boundary (0) on conflict. Key correction: `QueueEntry` bug fixed — original `neg_grad_bits: u64 = (-(grad as f64)).to_bits()` was incorrect because negated f64 IEEE 754 bit patterns are not monotonically ordered as u64 (−1.0 = 0xBFF… < −2.0 = 0xC00… as u64, so larger-magnitude negatives have larger u64 values, inverting the min-heap). Fixed with `grad_bits: u32 = (non-negative f32).to_bits()` and reversed comparison. Second bug: tie-breaking by linear index produced non-FIFO ordering at equal-gradient plateaus, causing incorrect boundary placement. Fixed with monotonic `seq: u64` insertion counter (FIFO tie-break). Re-exported in `watershed/mod.rs` and `segmentation/mod.rs`. 11 tests added. (3) GAP-R65-03: 10 adversarial multi-Otsu tests appended to `multi_otsu.rs`: K=4 threshold count/separation/label correctness; K=5 threshold count/separation/label validity; σ²_B = P₁·P₂·(μ₁−μ₂)² algebraic identity verified within 1e-9 for two-point histogram; monotone-input → non-decreasing labels; K > distinct values (no panic); single-voxel degenerate case. (4) GAP-R65-04: CLI `binary` method (`run_binary`) and `marker-watershed` method (`run_marker_watershed`) added to `crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/segment.rs`; `markers: Option<String>` field added to `SegmentArgs`; `BinaryThreshold` and `MarkerControlledWatershed` imports added. 4 CLI tests added. (5) GAP-R65-05: Python `binary_threshold_segment(image, lower=None, upper=None, inside_value=1.0, outside_value=0.0)` binding added to `crates/ritk-python/src/segmentation.rs` and registered in `lib.rs`. 765/765 ritk-core lib tests pass (+41 from Sprint 64 baseline of 724). 454/454 ritk-io lib tests pass (no change). 181/181 ritk-cli tests pass (+4 from Sprint 64 baseline of 177).

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R65-01 | `BinaryThreshold` (user-specified band filter) absent | **Closed** — Sprint 65: `threshold/binary.rs`; re-exported in `threshold/mod.rs` and `segmentation/mod.rs` |
| GAP-R65-02 | `MarkerControlledWatershed` absent | **Closed** — Sprint 65: `watershed/marker_controlled.rs`; FIFO priority-queue flooding; two QueueEntry ordering bugs fixed |
| GAP-R65-03 | Multi-Otsu K≥4 adversarial tests and σ²_B invariant absent | **Closed** — Sprint 65: 10 adversarial tests in `multi_otsu.rs` |
| GAP-R65-04 | CLI `binary` and `marker-watershed` methods absent | **Closed** — Sprint 65: `run_binary` + `run_marker_watershed` in `segment.rs` |
| GAP-R65-05 | Python `binary_threshold_segment` binding absent | **Closed** — Sprint 65: `binary_threshold_segment` in `ritk-python/src/segmentation.rs` |

## Sprint 66 Gap Closures

**Sprint 66 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R66-01: `statistics/mod.rs` `pub use normalization::` line expanded to re-export `NyulUdupaNormalizer`, `WhiteStripeNormalizer`, `WhiteStripeConfig`, `MriContrast`, `WhiteStripeResult` at the `ritk_core::statistics` facade; these types were already implemented in `normalization/` submodules but invisible to downstream consumers. Histogram matching (`HistogramMatcher`) was confirmed present from prior sprints; gap was an export omission and a CLI gap. (2) GAP-R66-02: `crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/normalize.rs` created — new `ritk normalize` CLI subcommand with five methods: `histogram-match` (requires `--reference`, configurable `--num-bins`), `nyul` (optional `--reference` to augment training set), `zscore`, `minmax`, `white-stripe` (accepts `--contrast t1/t2` and `--ws-width`). `pub mod normalize` added to `commands/mod.rs`. `Normalize(commands::normalize::NormalizeArgs)` variant and dispatch arm added to `main.rs`. 9 tests added in `normalize.rs` covering file creation, zscore zero-mean invariant, minmax [0,1] range invariant, histogram-match with/without reference, nyul single and dual image, unknown method error, and white-stripe invalid contrast error. (3) GAP-R66-03: BSpline FFD registration confirmed already closed in a prior sprint; `BSplineFFDRegistration` in `crates/ritk-registration/src/bspline_ffd/mod.rs`, re-exported from `ritk-registration/src/lib.rs`, Python binding `bspline_ffd_register` in `ritk-python/src/registration.rs`, and CLI `run_bspline_ffd` in `crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/register.rs` all confirmed present. Backlog entry corrected. (4) GAP-R66-04: `KMeansSegmentation` fields `max_iterations: usize`, `tolerance: f64`, `seed: u64` were implemented in core but unexposed in CLI and Python. Fix: three optional args `--kmeans-max-iterations`, `--kmeans-tolerance`, `--kmeans-seed` added to `SegmentArgs` in `segment.rs`; `run_kmeans` applies each via `if let Some`; Python `kmeans_segment` signature extended from `(image, k=3)` to `(image, k=3, max_iterations=None, tolerance=None, seed=None)`. 3 CLI tests added. 193/193 ritk-cli tests pass (+12 from Sprint 65 baseline of 181). 765/765 ritk-core lib tests pass (no change). 454/454 ritk-io lib tests pass (no change).

## Sprint 76 Gap Closures

**Sprint 76 (2026):** Four gaps closed; Elastix parity risk downgraded from Medium to Low.

(1) GAP-R76-01: 4 Elastix-dependent parity tests (`test_elastix_translation_recovers_sphere_overlap`, `test_ritk_demons_vs_elastix_translation_quality`, `test_elastix_bspline_deformable_vs_ritk_syn`, `test_elastix_parameter_map_api_matches_expected_keys`) permanently skipped because SimpleElastix is not installable on Python 3.13 (last release ~2018, no compatible wheels; installed SimpleITK 2.5.4 is vanilla build without `ElastixImageFilter`). Fix: replaced all 4 with SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod`-based tests using native ITK optimiser-driven registration. Three helper functions added: `_sitk_translation_register` (Euler3DTransform + Mattes MI + RegularStepGradientDescent), `_sitk_affine_register` (AffineTransform + multi-resolution [4,2,1]), `_sitk_bspline_register` (BSplineTransformInitializer + RegularStepGradientDescent). Four new tests: `test_sitk_translation_recovers_sphere_overlap` (Dice ≥ 0.85), `test_ritk_demons_vs_sitk_translation_quality` (RITK Demons Dice ≥ 0.85 vs SimpleITK reference), `test_sitk_bspline_deformable_vs_ritk_syn` (both Dice ≥ 0.80 on Gaussian-bump deformed sphere), `test_sitk_affine_registration_converges_on_shifted_sphere` (Dice ≥ 0.80). Result: 36/36 tests pass with 0 skipped (was 54 passed + 4 skipped).

(2) GAP-R76-02: `build_atlas` Python binding did not expose `gradient_step` — hardcoded `gradient_step: 0.25` in inner `MultiResSyNConfig` literal. Fix: added `gradient_step: f64 = 0.25` parameter to `build_atlas` PyO3 function signature, parameter list, and `.pyi` stub. All registration functions now uniformly expose `gradient_step`.

(3) GAP-R76-03: `_sitk_bspline_register` used `scale=False` keyword in `SetInitialTransform()` which is absent in SimpleITK 2.5.4. Fix: removed the keyword argument.

(4) GAP-R76-04: Affine Dice threshold 0.85 exceeded measured SimpleITK performance (0.8375). Analysis: 32³ volume with radius-6 sphere has 3845 foreground voxels; a 1-voxel residual translation error produces Dice ≈ 0.83. Multi-resolution affine with sampled MI cannot reliably achieve 0.85 on this volume. Fix: lowered threshold to 0.80 with analytical justification in docstring.

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R76-01 | 4 Elastix parity tests permanently skipped — SimpleElastix not installable on Python 3.13 | **Closed** — Sprint 76: replaced with SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod`-based parity tests; 36/36 pass, 0 skipped |
| GAP-R76-02 | `build_atlas` Python binding did not expose `gradient_step` | **Closed** — Sprint 76: `gradient_step: f64 = 0.25` added to PyO3 signature and pyi stub |
| GAP-R76-03 | `_sitk_bspline_register` API incompatibility with SimpleITK 2.5.4 | **Closed** — Sprint 76: removed `scale=False` kwarg from `SetInitialTransform` |
| GAP-R76-04 | Affine Dice threshold 0.85 exceeded measured SimpleITK performance | **Closed** — Sprint 76: threshold lowered to 0.80 with analytical justification |

### Sprint 76 closure notes

- The Elastix → ImageRegistrationMethod parity replacement is permanent. SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod` provides equivalent optimiser-driven registration (Mattes MI + RegularStepGradientDescent + transform hierarchy) without requiring the archived SimpleElastix package. If SimpleElastix becomes available in a future Python version, the `ImageRegistrationMethod` tests remain valid as an independent reference baseline.
- `build_atlas` was the last registration function hardcoding `gradient_step`. After this sprint, all 7 registration functions (`syn_register`, `multires_syn_register`, `bspline_syn_register`, `bspline_ffd_register`, `demons_register`, `symmetric_demons_register`, `build_atlas`) expose `gradient_step` consistently.

| GAP-R08 (Elastix parity) | **Downgraded from Medium to Low** — ImageRegistrationMethod parity now active; Elastix-specific `ParameterMap`/`ElastixImageFilter` API absent but no longer blocks test coverage. SimpleElastix is archived software; no future release is anticipated. |
| BSplineSyN `gradient_step` field unused | Low — field present for API consistency; CP accumulation provides implicit magnitude control |

---

## Sprint 75 Gap Closures

**Sprint 75 (2026):** Four gaps closed; SyN translation recovery risk removed. (1) GAP-R75-01: Incorrect CC gradient force formula in all three `cc_forces` functions. The prior formula `force_scale = -2*cc_num/(var_i*var_j)` equals `-2*CC/sqrt(var_i*var_j)` because `cc_num = CC*sqrt(var_i*var_j)`. For positively correlated images (CC > 0) this pushes the velocity field in the wrong direction (gradient descent on CC rather than ascent), preventing any translation from being recovered. Fix: implement Avants 2008 eq. 10 in full: `force_scale = (J_W(x)-mu_J)/sqrt(var_i*var_j) - CC*(I_W(x)-mu_I)/var_i`. This is gradient ascent on CC (minimising 1-CC). Applied identically in `diffeomorphic/mod.rs` (greedy SyN), `diffeomorphic/multires_syn.rs` (multi-resolution SyN), and `diffeomorphic/bspline_syn.rs` (BSpline SyN). (2) GAP-R75-02: Raw CC gradient forces were accumulated without step-size normalization. Gaussian regularization smoothed out small forces before they accumulated. Fix: added `gradient_step: f64 = 0.25` to `SyNConfig` and `MultiResSyNConfig`; forces normalised per iteration so max|u| = gradient_step (inf-norm). This matches ANTs `gradientStep = 0.2` convention and decouples step size from image intensity scale. `BSplineSyNConfig::gradient_step` added for API uniformity (field unused in current BSplineSyn loop since CP accumulation provides implicit scale). (3) GAP-R75-03: Python bindings `syn_register`, `multires_syn_register`, `bspline_syn_register` updated to expose `gradient_step: float = 0.25`; PyO3 signature attribute, docstring, and `.pyi` stub updated; `build_atlas` inner `MultiResSyNConfig` literal (missing field, compile error) fixed. (4) GAP-R75-04: `test_syn_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_gaussian_blob` added to `test_simpleitk_parity.py` Section 5. Uses a Gaussian blob (sigma=4, 24³ volume, 4-voxel x-shift) — linear-ramp images are unsuitable because local CC is shift-invariant for linear ramps. After 50 iterations of fixed SyN (gradient_step=0.25, sigma_smooth=1.5), NCC_after > NCC_before and NCC_after ≥ 0.80. Test passes on rebuilt wheel.

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R75-01 | SyN CC gradient formula inverted — `cc_forces` used `-2*cc_num/(var_i*var_j)` (descent on CC for CC>0) | **Closed** — Sprint 75: Avants 2008 eq. 10 implemented; `force_scale = (J_W-mu_J)/denom - CC*(I_W-mu_I)/var_i` in all three SyN variants |
| GAP-R75-02 | No step-size normalization — raw force magnitude depends on image intensity scale | **Closed** — Sprint 75: `gradient_step: f64 = 0.25` added to `SyNConfig` and `MultiResSyNConfig`; forces normalised to inf-norm = gradient_step per iteration |
| GAP-R75-03 | `gradient_step` absent from Python `syn_register` / `multires_syn_register` / `bspline_syn_register` | **Closed** — Sprint 75: all three Python functions, stubs, and docstrings updated; `build_atlas` compile error fixed |
| GAP-R75-04 | No Python parity test for SyN NCC improvement | **Closed** — Sprint 75: `test_syn_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_gaussian_blob` added; passes (NCC_after ≥ 0.80) |

### Sprint 75 closure notes
- The root defect was a sign error in the CC gradient: `cc_num = CC * sqrt(var_i*var_j)`, so `-2*cc_num/(var_i*var_j) = -2*CC/sqrt(var_i*var_j)`. For CC > 0 this is negative, giving descent rather than ascent. The correct first-order gradient is `+jw_c/denom`.
- Gaussian blob images are the canonical synthetic test class for SyN. Linear-ramp images are unsuitable: local CC of any linear ramp equals 1.0 regardless of x-offset, making the gradient identically zero for all positions except at the zero-padding boundary.
- After the fix, `syn_recovers_translation_ncc_improves` (Rust) and `test_syn_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_gaussian_blob` (Python) both pass with NCC_after ≥ 0.80.
- The SyN translation recovery risk (open since Sprint 74) is removed from the risk register.

## Sprint 74 Gap Closures

**Sprint 74 (2026):** Five gaps closed. (1) GAP-R74-01: Python wheel DLL load failure resolved on Windows. The `nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` default toolchain produces `_ritk.dll` linked against MinGW runtime libraries (`libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll`, `libwinpthread-1.dll`). Windows-native CPython 3.13 (MSVC ABI) cannot locate these DLLs via the default search path. Fix: build with `rustup run nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc py -m maturin build --release --auditwheel repair`; maturin copies the three MinGW DLLs into a `ritk.libs/` directory inside the wheel and patches the DLL search path at import time. `py -c "import ritk; print('ok')"` → confirmed working. (2) GAP-R74-02: `crates/ritk-python/README.md` created with build requirements, correct `--auditwheel repair` build command, test execution instructions, module API table (filter/registration/segmentation/statistics/io submodules), architecture description, and DICOM I/O dispatch documentation. (3) GAP-R74-03: `test_vtk_parity.py` extended with 8 new CT/MRI-relevant VTK parity tests: `test_vtk_threshold_matches_sitk_binary_threshold` (vtkImageThreshold vs SimpleITK BinaryThresholdImageFilter, Dice ≥ 0.99); `test_vtk_reslice_identity_preserves_sphere` (vtkImageReslice identity, interior NRMSE < 0.02); `test_vtk_ct_bimodal_statistics_agree_with_numpy` (CT-like air/tissue bimodal image, |vtk_mean − np_mean| < 5 HU); `test_vtk_cross_modal_ncc_lower_than_monomodal_ncc` (inverted-sphere MRI-like image, NCC_cross < NCC_monomodal — validates cross-modal registration premise); `test_vtk_image_accumulate_histogram_bin_counts_sum_to_nvoxels` (mass conservation: Σ bin_counts = N_voxels); `test_vtk_anisotropic_diffusion_reduces_peak_spike` (DiffusionThreshold=200, spike gradient 100 < 200 → diffuses, peak_after < peak_before × 0.5); `test_vtk_image_cast_to_float_preserves_integer_values` (VTK_SHORT → VTK_FLOAT, exact f32 preservation for integers [0, 26]); `test_vtk_gradient_magnitude_nonunit_spacing_agrees_with_sitk` (0.5 mm spacing, sphere image, Pearson r ≥ 0.95, peak gradient ∈ [1.0, 4.0] mm⁻¹). All 18 VTK tests pass in 5.11 s. Key fix: `vtkImageThreshold` requires the `BinaryThresholdImageFilter` class API (not the functional `sitk.BinaryThreshold`) with integer 1/0 inside/outside values; `DiffusionThreshold` in vtkImageAnisotropicDiffusion3D means "diffuse faces with gradient < threshold" (same polarity as Perona-Malik conductance). (4) GAP-R74-04: `test_simpleitk_parity.py` extended with Section 5 — 5 registration quality parity tests: `test_bspline_ffd_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_gaussian_blob` (Gaussian blob sigma=4, shift=4, LR=1.0, no regularization, NCC_after > NCC_before ∧ NCC_after ≥ 0.80; binary sphere images cause premature convergence due to near-zero interior gradients — smooth images required); `test_symmetric_demons_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_sphere` (100 iterations, sigma=1.0, NCC ≥ 0.90, measured ≈ 0.97); `test_histogram_match_output_agrees_with_sitk` (Pearson r ≥ 0.99 vs SimpleITK HistogramMatchingImageFilter, 128 bins); `test_histogram_match_shifts_source_median_toward_reference_median` (p50 strictly closer to reference after matching); `test_demons_register_ncc_improves_on_shifted_sphere` (Thirion Demons, NCC ≥ 0.80). 5/5 pass. Note: SyN (`syn_register`) does not recover translations reliably on the test configurations trialled (NCC unchanged for shifts 2–6 voxels, both binary and smooth images); `warped_fixed` output equals the original fixed image identically. Investigation shows the velocity fields do not accumulate sufficient magnitude under sigma_smooth=1.0–3.0 to produce a measurable warp for these synthetic volumes. Symmetric Demons is used as the high-quality diffeomorphic parity reference instead. (5) GAP-R74-05: `crates/ritk-python/tests/test_ct_mri_registration_parity.py` created with 4 real-DICOM CT/MRI parity tests guarded by `@pytest.mark.skipif(not _DATA_PRESENT, ...)`: `test_ct_statistics_agree_with_sitk` (min/max/mean within 5% rel tol, CT HU sanity: min < −500, max > 200); `test_mri_statistics_agree_with_sitk` (min/max/mean within 5%, MRI sanity: min ≥ 0, mean > 0); `test_ct_mri_ncc_is_low_before_registration` (|NCC| < 0.5 on 32³ central crops, validates cross-modal registration premise); `test_histogram_match_ct_to_mri_reduces_distribution_gap` (minmax-normalised crops, gap_after < gap_before). All 4 pass with MRI-DIR DICOM pair present. All 53 Python parity tests pass (4 skipped: Elastix absent).

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R74-01 | Python wheel DLL load failure on Windows (MinGW runtime vs MSVC Python ABI mismatch) | **Closed** — Sprint 74: `--auditwheel repair` bundles MinGW DLLs into `ritk.libs/`; `ritk` imports successfully in CPython 3.13 |
| GAP-R74-02 | No build/test documentation for `ritk-python` | **Closed** — Sprint 74: `crates/ritk-python/README.md` created with full build, test, API, and architecture documentation |
| GAP-R74-03 | VTK parity tests lacked CT/MRI-relevant operations (resampling, CT statistics, cross-modal NCC, anisotropic diffusion, cast, spacing) | **Closed** — Sprint 74: 8 new tests added; `test_vtk_parity.py` now has 18 tests (all pass) |
| GAP-R74-04 | SimpleITK parity tests lacked registration quality tests (BSpline FFD, Demons variants, histogram matching) | **Closed** — Sprint 74: Section 5 added; 5 registration quality tests pass |
| GAP-R74-05 | No Python-level CT/MRI DICOM parity tests using real MRI-DIR data | **Closed** — Sprint 74: `test_ct_mri_registration_parity.py` created; 4 tests pass with downloaded MRI-DIR pair |

### Sprint 74 closure notes
- VTK `DiffusionThreshold` semantic: faces with gradient magnitude **below** the threshold are diffused (same as Perona-Malik conductance); to diffuse a spike with gradient ≈ 100, set threshold > 100.
- BSpline FFD requires smooth input images (e.g. Gaussian blob sigma ≥ 2) for the NCC gradient to accumulate. Binary sphere images produce near-zero interior gradients and trigger premature convergence (rel_change < 1e-6 after first iteration).
- SyN translation recovery gap is a known limitation in the current implementation: velocity fields do not accumulate for synthetic translation test cases. Symmetric Demons is the recommended parity reference for diffeomorphic registration quality.
- CT/MRI DICOM parity tests self-skip when `test_data/3_head_ct_mridir/DICOM/` and `test_data/2_head_mri_t2/DICOM/` are absent, consistent with the `#[ignore]` pattern in the Rust integration tests.

## Sprint 73 Gap Closures

**Sprint 73 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R73-01: Three `ritk-snap` compiler warnings eliminated. `loader.rs:302` doc comment (`///`) on nested closure changed to plain comment (`//`); `loader.rs:304` `let mut try_add` → `let try_add` (closure never rebinds); `app.rs:1109` `step_slice` dead-code warning resolved by replacing four direct `step_slice_for_axis(self.axis, ±1)` call sites in `show_menu_bar` and `show_central_panel_single` with `self.step_slice(±1)` — the method now participates in scroll and keyboard dispatch. `cargo check -p ritk-snap --tests` → 0 errors, 0 warnings. (2) GAP-R73-02: 409-slice cranial CT DICOM series downloaded from TCIA MRI-DIR collection (PatientID `MRI-DIR-zzmeatphantom`, SeriesInstanceUID `1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.1706.4996.115936088547498980797393821518`, 79.9 MB ZIP, CC BY 4.0) and extracted to `test_data/3_head_ct_mridir/DICOM/`. Geometry: 512×512 in-plane, 0.390625 mm pixel spacing, 0.625 mm slice thickness. This CT is from the **same phantom** as the existing `test_data/2_head_mri_t2/` T2 MRI (94 slices), providing a true CT↔MRI pair with implanted 0.35 mm gold fiducial markers for ground-truth registration accuracy evaluation (Ger et al. 2018, DOI: 10.1002/mp.13090). `test_data/README.md` updated with the new dataset section, pairing note, and W/L reference values. (3) GAP-R73-03: `crates/ritk-python/tests/test_vtk_parity.py` created with 10 value-semantic VTK 9.6.1 ↔ SimpleITK 2.5.4 filter parity tests. Covered operations: `vtkImageGaussianSmooth` (constant-image invariant + sphere NRMSE < 0.15 vs SimpleITK `DiscreteGaussianImageFilter`); `vtkImageGradientMagnitude` (linear ramp → analytical magnitude 1.0; Pearson r > 0.95 vs SimpleITK); `vtkImageLaplacian` (linear image → ∇²=0); `vtkImageMedian3D` (single-spike suppression); `vtkImageDilateErode3D` (erosion shrinks sphere A⊖B⊆A; dilation grows sphere A⊆A⊕B); `vtkImageAccumulate` scalar range vs analytical. All 10 tests pass in 1.23 s. Key fix: `SetDimensionality(3)` required on all VTK gradient/Laplacian instances (default=2 silently skips z-axis). Numpy–VTK axis contract (`arr[iz,iy,ix]` ravelled `order='F'` maps to VTK x=iz, y=iy, z=ix) documented at module scope. (4) GAP-R73-04: `crates/ritk-registration/tests/ct_mri_dicom_registration_test.rs` created with 4 integration tests (all `#[ignore = "requires test data"]`). Tests: `test_ct_dicom_series_metadata` (modality=CT, shape 405–413×512×512, spacing invariants); `test_mri_dir_mri_series_metadata` (modality=MR, 92–96 slices, non-trivial intensity range); `test_bspline_ffd_mridir_ct_synthetic_shift_recovery` (stride-16 downsampling to ≈32³, 2-voxel x-shift, BSpline FFD NCC_after > NCC_before, NCC_after ≥ 0.80); `test_ct_mri_pair_intensity_statistics_differ` (CT HU range > 100, cross-modality NCC < 0.95). `cargo check --test ct_mri_dicom_registration_test -p ritk-registration` → 0 errors, 0 warnings.

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R73-01 | 3 `ritk-snap` compiler warnings (unused doc comment, unused mut, dead code `step_slice`) | **Closed** — Sprint 73: doc comment → plain comment in `loader.rs:302`; `mut` removed from `loader.rs:304`; `step_slice` connected to scroll/keyboard handler in `app.rs` |
| GAP-R73-02 | MRI-DIR CT test data absent; only porcine phantom MRI existed without paired CT | **Closed** — Sprint 73: 409-slice CT (512×512, 0.625 mm, CC BY 4.0) downloaded to `test_data/3_head_ct_mridir/DICOM/`; `test_data/README.md` updated |
| GAP-R73-03 | No VTK parity tests for image filter operations | **Closed** — Sprint 73: `test_vtk_parity.py` added; 10 tests covering Gaussian, gradient, Laplacian, median, binary morphology, statistics; all pass |
| GAP-R73-04 | No CT/MRI DICOM registration integration tests | **Closed** — Sprint 73: `ct_mri_dicom_registration_test.rs` added; 4 `#[ignore]` tests validating DICOM metadata + BSpline FFD NCC improvement on real CT sub-volume |

### Sprint 73 closure notes
- VTK filter parity tests use `pytest.importorskip` guards; they are skipped gracefully when VTK or SimpleITK are absent, consistent with the Elastix `@skipif` pattern in `test_simpleitk_parity.py`.
- The CT/MRI DICOM integration tests are marked `#[ignore]` because they require the 79.9 MB `test_data/3_head_ct_mridir/DICOM/` data, which is not committed to version control.
- `step_slice` now reduces duplication: all ±1 axial step call sites use the method, which delegates to `step_slice_for_axis(self.axis, delta)`.
- The MRI-DIR phantom CT+MRI pair (same anatomy, gold fiducial ground truth) is the canonical CT↔MRI registration test dataset for RITK.

## Sprint 72 Gap Closures

**Sprint 72 (2026):** Ten gaps closed. (1) GAP-R72-01: `SnapApp` struct implementing `eframe::App` added in `crates/ritk-snap/src/app.rs`; `main.rs` binary entry point calls `run_app`; `lib.rs` extended with `LoadedVolume`, `run_app`, and module declarations for `render`, `tools`, `dicom`, and `ui` submodules. (2) GAP-R72-02: `SidebarPanel` added in `crates/ritk-snap/src/ui/sidebar.rs`; Patient→Study→Series tree populated by `scan_dicom_directory` via `dicom/series_tree.rs`. (3) GAP-R72-03: 2×2 `MprLayout` with axial, coronal, and sagittal viewports implemented in `crates/ritk-snap/src/ui/layout.rs` and `ui/viewport.rs`. (4) GAP-R72-04: `WindowPreset` with 14 CT presets (e.g., bone, lung, brain, abdomen) and 4 MR presets implemented in `crates/ritk-snap/src/ui/window_presets.rs`; preset selection exposed via View → Window menu. (5) GAP-R72-05: `ToolKind` enum and `InteractionState` implemented in `crates/ritk-snap/src/tools/kind.rs` and `tools/interaction.rs`; Length, Angle, Rect ROI, Ellipse ROI, and HU-point tools rendered and measured in `ui/measurements.rs` with mm-accurate computation using DICOM pixel-spacing metadata. (6) GAP-R72-06: `load_nifti_volume` dispatched via `ritk-io` in the GUI file-open handler; `LoadedVolume` carries the NIfTI volume with affine metadata. (7) GAP-R72-07: `OverlayRenderer` added in `crates/ritk-snap/src/ui/overlay.rs`; renders Patient/Study/Series/Slice DICOM tags at 4 corners and patient orientation labels (L/R, A/P, S/I) on each viewport edge. (8) GAP-R72-08: PNG export calls `rfd::FileDialog` save-file picker then encodes the current viewport slice via the `image` crate in `crates/ritk-snap/src/ui/toolbar.rs`. (9) GAP-R72-09: 94-slice MRI-DIR head T2 DICOM series downloaded from TCIA (CC BY 4.0) to `test_data/2_head_mri_t2/DICOM/`; provenance, license, and intended use documented in `test_data/README.md`. (10) GAP-R72-10: 7 colormaps (grayscale, hot, cool, jet, viridis, plasma, bone) implemented as piecewise-linear LUT tables in `crates/ritk-snap/src/render/colormap.rs`; `SliceRenderer` in `render/slice_render.rs` applies the active LUT during texture update; 42+ colormap and render tests added. Commit a3b08bd pushed to origin/main. 102/102 tests pass workspace-wide (up from 42 pre-Sprint-72 baseline).

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R72-01 | ritk-snap had no GUI application shell | **Closed** — `SnapApp` eframe/egui binary implemented in `crates/ritk-snap/src/app.rs` and `main.rs` |
| GAP-R72-02 | No DICOM series browser in ritk-snap | **Closed** — `SidebarPanel` with Patient→Study→Series tree via `scan_dicom_directory` in `ui/sidebar.rs` and `dicom/series_tree.rs` |
| GAP-R72-03 | No MPR layout in viewer | **Closed** — 2×2 `MprLayout` with axial/coronal/sagittal viewports in `ui/layout.rs` and `ui/viewport.rs` |
| GAP-R72-04 | No W/L presets in viewer | **Closed** — `WindowPreset` with 14 CT + 4 MR clinical presets in `ui/window_presets.rs` |
| GAP-R72-05 | No measurement tools in viewer | **Closed** — Length, Angle, Rect/Ellipse ROI, HU-point in `tools/` and `ui/measurements.rs` |
| GAP-R72-06 | No NIfTI loading in viewer | **Closed** — `load_nifti_volume` dispatch via `ritk-io` in GUI file-open handler |
| GAP-R72-07 | No DICOM overlay in viewer | **Closed** — 4-corner DICOM text overlay + orientation labels in `ui/overlay.rs` |
| GAP-R72-08 | No slice export in viewer | **Closed** — PNG export via `rfd` file dialog in `ui/toolbar.rs` |
| GAP-R72-09 | Missing cranial MRI DICOM test data | **Closed** — MRI-DIR T2 head phantom (94 slices, CC BY 4.0) in `test_data/2_head_mri_t2/DICOM/`; documented in `test_data/README.md` |
| GAP-R72-10 | No colormaps in viewer | **Closed** — 7 piecewise-linear LUT colormaps in `render/colormap.rs`; 42+ tests added |

### Sprint 72 closure notes
- `SnapApp` satisfies the `GuiBackend` trait boundary; no domain logic is bound to a concrete egui import outside the `ui/` submodule.
- Colormap LUTs are encoded as piecewise-linear control-point tables; adding a new colormap requires only a new entry in the table registry.
- `WindowPreset` stores presets as data; W/L variation is not encoded in function names or cloned logic.
- Measurement tools derive mm-accurate values from DICOM `PixelSpacing` and `SliceThickness` metadata stored in `LoadedVolume`.
- `test_data/README.md` documents dataset provenance, license, and intended test scope for all datasets in the repository.

## Sprint 71 Gap Closures

**Sprint 71 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R71-01: `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/_ritk/statistics.pyi` updated so `zscore_normalize` exposes `mask: Image | None = None`, matching the compiled binding signature. (2) GAP-R71-02: `crates/ritk-python/tests/test_statistics_bindings.py` added `test_zscore_normalize_masked_matches_foreground_shape`, which asserts masked dispatch, finite output, foreground voxel count, and zero foreground mean by construction. (3) GAP-R71-03: `test_smoke.py` and `test_statistics_bindings.py` now align with the compiled `zscore_normalize(image, mask=None)` callable signature; no additional change was required beyond the stub/test update. (4) GAP-R71-04: `backlog.md`, `checklist.md`, and `gap_audit.md` were refreshed after verification. 777/777 ritk-core lib tests pass (unchanged). 197/197 ritk-cli tests pass (unchanged). 11/11 ritk-python lib tests pass (unchanged).

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R71-01 | `zscore_normalize` Python stub lacks optional `mask` parity | **Closed** — `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/_ritk/statistics.pyi` now exposes `def zscore_normalize(image: Image, mask: Image | None = None) -> Image` |
| GAP-R71-02 | `zscore_normalize(mask=...)` positive smoke case absent | **Closed** — `test_zscore_normalize_masked_matches_foreground_shape` asserts masked dispatch and value semantics |
| GAP-R71-03 | `test_smoke.py` / `test_statistics_bindings.py` callable-surface drift audit | **Closed** — verified alignment with `zscore_normalize(image, mask=None)` after stub updates |
| GAP-R71-04 | Sprint 71 artifact refresh pending | **Closed** — backlog, checklist, and gap audit updated after verification |

### Sprint 71 closure notes
- `zscore_normalize` stub/runtime parity is now explicit in `crates/ritk-python/python/ritk/_ritk/statistics.pyi`.
- `test_zscore_normalize_masked_matches_foreground_shape` validates masked z-score behavior with matching shapes and computed-value assertions.
- The existing `minmax_normalize_range` inverted-bounds regression remains valid and unchanged.
- `run_lddmm` learning-rate wiring is already present and requires no code change.

## Sprint 68 Gap Closures

**Sprint 68 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R68-01: `ZScoreNormalizer::normalize_masked` added to `ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/zscore.rs`; computes μ and σ from mask foreground voxels (falls back to `compute_statistics` on empty mask to avoid `masked_statistics` contract violation); `zscore_normalize` Python binding extended with `#[pyo3(signature=(image, mask=None))]`; dispatches `normalize_masked` when mask is provided, `normalize` otherwise; 3 core tests added. (2) GAP-R68-02: `convergence_threshold: 1e-6` hard-code removed from `run_bspline_syn`; replaced with `convergence_threshold: args.convergence_threshold`; `RegisterArgs.convergence_threshold` docstring updated to name both BSpline FFD and BSpline SyN. (3) GAP-R68-03: `test_segment_marker_watershed_creates_output_with_correct_shape` and `test_segment_marker_watershed_output_contains_both_basin_labels` added to `ritk-cli/src/commands/segment.rs`; helpers `make_uniform_gradient_image` and `make_two_seed_marker_image` co-located in `mod tests`; tests assert shape=[3,3,3] and both basin labels 1 and 2 present in output. (4) GAP-R68-04: `validate_percentiles(p: &[f64]) -> Result<(), String>` extracted as private helper in `ritk-python/src/statistics.rs`; inline validation in `nyul_udupa_normalize` refactored to call helper (error messages byte-for-byte identical); 6 `#[cfg(test)]` tests added: empty slice, single element, equal pair, descending pair, minimal valid ascending pair, standard 13-element Nyul set. 777/777 ritk-core lib tests pass (+3 from Sprint 67 baseline of 774). 195/195 ritk-cli tests pass (+2). 6/6 ritk-python lib tests pass (new).

| ID | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GAP-R68-01 | `zscore_normalize` Python binding missing optional `mask` parameter | **Closed** — Sprint 68: `ZScoreNormalizer::normalize_masked` added to core; Python binding extended with `mask=None` optional parameter |

| GAP-R68-03 | `marker_watershed_segment` CLI integration smoke test absent | **Closed** — Sprint 68: two integration tests added to `segment.rs`; shape and label-presence asserted |
| GAP-R68-04 | `nyul_udupa_normalize` `percentiles` parameter lacks Python-level negative tests | **Closed** — Sprint 68: `validate_percentiles` helper extracted; 6 negative/positive tests added |

**Sprint 67 (2026):** Four gaps closed. (1) GAP-R67-01: `histogram_match` Python binding extended with `#[pyo3(signature=(source,reference,num_bins=256))]`; guard `num_bins < 2 → PyValueError`; `nyul_udupa_normalize` Python binding extended with `percentiles: Option<Vec<f64>>`; pre-GIL validation (length ≥ 2, strictly ascending) before calling `NyulUdupaNormalizer::with_percentiles`; dispatches `::with_percentiles(p)` or `::new()` depending on presence. (2) GAP-R67-02: `MarkerControlledWatershed` added to `use` imports in `ritk-python/src/segmentation.rs`; `marker_watershed_segment(gradient, markers)` function added before the `register` function; registered in submodule under `// Watershed`. (3) GAP-R67-03: 5 adversarial tests added to `confidence_connected.rs`: (a) multi-seed two-cube isolation (seed A→3 voxels, seed B→3 voxels, no bleed); (b) large-k expansion on gradient image (k=2.0→2 voxels, k=10.0→3 voxels on [100,130,10]); (c) corner seed [0,0,0] on 4×4×4 uniform→64 voxels; (d) `max_iterations=0`→only seed voxel; (e) exact `initial_lower`/`initial_upper` boundary values inclusive. 4 adversarial tests added to `neighborhood_connected.rs`: (a) multi-seed two-cube isolation; (b) radius overflow clamped to domain (radius [2,2,2] on 3×3×3→27); (c) 6×6×6 uniform large-radius→216; (d) noisy boundary shell (5×5×5, shell=5, interior=200, radius [1,1,1]→1 voxel). (4) GAP-R67-04: `convergence_threshold: f64` field added to `RegisterArgs` (default `0.00001`); positioned after `regularization_weight`; `..Default::default()` removed from `run_bspline_ffd`; all 6 `BSplineFFDConfig` fields now explicitly set; 22 test struct literals updated. 774/774 ritk-core lib tests pass (+9 from Sprint 66 baseline of 765). 193/193 ritk-cli tests pass (no change).

## 1. Executive Summary

RITK has a well-structured core (image primitives, transforms, interpolation) and a strong
registration layer (classical Kabsch/MI + deep-learning TransMorph/SSMMorph). It covers the
most performance-sensitive registration metrics (MI, NCC, LNCC, NMI) and a complete
regularization suite.

Against **ITK** (≈1 200 image filters, full segmentation pipeline, 30+ IO formats), **SimpleITK**
(Python/R/Java/C# bindings, N4 bias field correction, histogram matching), **VTK**
(visualization, mesh/scene graph, polydata pipeline), **ITK-SNAP**
(interactive segmentation / annotation / overlay workflows), **ANTs**
(robust diffeomorphic registration workflows), and **Grassroots DICOM**
(comprehensive DICOM object model and interoperability tooling), RITK has **six structural gaps**
that collectively prevent it from being used as a drop-in toolkit in standard clinical or research
imaging workflows:

| Gap Domain | Severity | ITK Parity | SimpleITK Parity | ANTs Parity | VTK / DICOM Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Segmentation | **High** | ~45% | ~45% | ~45% | ITK / SimpleITK: still missing a broad set of region, deformable, and topology-preserving operators |
| Filtering & Preprocessing | **High** | ~55% | ~55% | ~55% | ITK / SimpleITK: still missing the long tail of multiscale, PDE, and topology-aware filters |
| Diffeomorphic Registration | **Medium** | ~85% | ~85% | ~85% | ANTs: still lacking exact-inverse Demons and some production-grade inverse-consistency controls |
| Statistics & Normalization | **Medium** | ~55% | ~55% | ~55% | SimpleITK: broad utilities remain, but core normalization coverage is now substantial |
| IO Formats | **High** | ~58% | ~58% | ~58% | ITK / VTK / DICOM: still missing full codec breadth, mesh/scene formats, and deep DICOM object coverage |
| DICOM Read Metadata | **High** | N/A | N/A | N/A | DICOM: object-model preservation, private tags, nested sequences, and multi-frame / enhanced images remain incomplete |
| VTK Data Model | **High** | ~20% | ~20% | ~20% | VTK: image I/O exists, but data-object hierarchy, mesh grids, and pipeline abstractions are absent |
| ITK-SNAP Workflow | **Medium-High** | ~10% | ~10% | ~10% | ITK-SNAP: interactive segmentation state, labels, overlays, and undo/redo primitives are absent |
| VTK Data Model | **High** | ~20% | ~20% | ~20% | VTK: image I/O exists, but data-object hierarchy, mesh grids, and pipeline abstractions are absent |

| ITK-SNAP Workflow | **Medium-High** | ~10% | ~10% | ~10% | ITK-SNAP: interactive segmentation state, labels, overlays, and undo/redo primitives are absent |
| Python / CLI Bindings | **Low** | ~95% | ~95% | ~95% | SimpleITK: `ritk` is close on bindings breadth, but high-level façade conventions remain narrower |

Sprint 3 filter additions (N4, Perona-Malik, gradient magnitude, Laplacian, Frangi) moved
Filtering & Preprocessing from Critical to High severity. Addition of Thirion/Diffeomorphic/
Symmetric Demons and greedy SyN moved Diffeomorphic Registration from Critical to High severity.
The `ritk-cli` binary and extended Python bindings materially advanced CLI/Python parity.
The DICOM subsystem now has a read-side metadata slice that captures series identity plus per-slice geometry and rescale fields.

The DICOM implementation remains series-centric. The remaining DICOM backlog is:
The remaining DICOM backlog is:
- transfer syntax coverage audit
- enhanced multi-frame conformance and interoperability validation
- generalized DICOM writer
- metadata-aware read-path validation for `DicomReadMetadata` and `DicomSliceMetadata`
- object-model round-trip preservation
- explicit unknown-element retention
- object-model preservation across read/write round-trips
- explicit handling of sequence values and unknown elements
- synthetic end-to-end integration tests covering explicit non-image SOP rejection paths
- transfer syntax UID read fixed (obj.meta().transfer_syntax() from file meta, Sprint 45)
- metadata round-trip validated: spatial fields, rescale params, transfer syntax UID (Sprint 45)

The next-stage roadmap is:
1. DICOM object-model foundation and non-image SOP integration hardening
2. VTK data model and mesh primitives
3. ITK/SimpleITK algorithm breadth expansion with CLI surface completion for Sprint 28 filters
4. ITK-SNAP workflow primitives

from ~65% to ~80%. TIFF/BigTIFF reader/writer raised IO parity from ~30% to ~35%. Full 8-function
Python registration API raised Python/CLI parity from ~65% to ~75%.

**Sprint 7 (2025-07-18) completed the following previously absent components:**

  Closes PY-STAT.
- **Test coverage**: 454 tests passing in ritk-core (+33), 162 in ritk-registration (+12),
  79 in ritk-io (+29). Zero failures, zero warnings.

Sprint 7 atlas registration and joint label fusion raised Diffeomorphic Registration parity
from ~80% to ~85%. MGH/MGZ reader/writer raised IO parity from ~35% to ~45%. Euclidean distance
transform raised Segmentation parity from ~35% to ~40%. White stripe normalization raised
Statistics parity from ~50% to ~55%. 13-function Python statistics API raised Python/CLI parity
from ~75% to ~80%.

  majority-vote fusion, joint label fusion, and composite transform JSON I/O. Closes PY-08.
- **Verification status:** prior workspace verification recorded 864 passing tests, 0 failures.
  Current bounded reruns reached a passing `ritk-cli` suite (107 tests) before timeout while the
  workspace was rebuilding Python dependencies; no failing diagnostics were observed in captured output.

Sprint 8 VTK and JPEG support raised IO parity from ~45% to ~50%. Completed CLI command coverage
and packaged Python stubs raised Python/CLI parity from ~80% to ~90%. Atlas/label-fusion Python
exposure improved ANTs-style workflow parity without changing the underlying registration-core
parity classification.

Parity percentages are estimated against the feature count of each reference toolkit relevant to
medical 3D imaging use cases (excluding legacy 2D-only or deprecated filters).

#### GAP-R08 — Elastix / ITK-Elastix Registration Interface · Severity: **Low**

**References:**
- Klein et al. (2010), *J. Biomed. Inform.* 43(1):13–29 (Elastix).
- Shamonin et al. (2014), *Front. Neuroinform.* 7:50 (Multi-threaded Elastix).
- SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod` (ITK optimiser-driven registration, used as parity reference since Sprint 76).

**Status (Sprint 76):** SimpleElastix is archived software (last release ~2018) with no Python ≥3.9 wheels. The installed SimpleITK 2.5.4 is the vanilla build (no `ElastixImageFilter`). Sprint 76 replaced the 4 skipped Elastix-dependent parity tests with 4 SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod`-based tests that provide equivalent optimiser-driven registration reference baselines (Mattes MI + RegularStepGradientDescent + Euler3D/Affine/BSpline transform hierarchy). Parity test coverage is now active (36/36 pass, 0 skipped). The remaining gap is the parameter-map–driven interface and ASGD optimizer, which are convenience/API-parity items rather than correctness requirements.

**Gap description:** Elastix is a parameter-map-driven registration framework that bundles:
**Gap description:**
Elastix is a parameter-map-driven registration framework that bundles:
1. **Metric family** — AdvancedMattesMutualInformation (AMI) with Parzen-window KDE,
   AdvancedNormalizedCorrelation, AdvancedMeanSquares.
2. **Optimizer** — AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent (ASGD) with automatic parameter
   estimation (`AutomaticParameterEstimation = "true"`).
3. **Sampler** — RandomCoordinate spatial sampling with configurable `NumberOfSpatialSamples`.
4. **Transform family** — Translation, Euler3D (rigid), Similarity3D, Affine, BSpline
   (non-rigid, grid spacing in physical units).
5. **Multi-resolution pyramid** — FixedSmoothingImagePyramid / MovingRecursiveImagePyramid.
6. **Parameter-map interface** — `GetDefaultParameterMap("translation"|"rigid"|"affine"|"bspline")`
   with full key–value customisation, file I/O (`ReadParameterFile`/`WriteParameterFile`).
7. **Transformix** — `TransformixImageFilter` for applying a saved transform parameter map
   to a new moving image, computing the deformation field, determinant of Jacobian, or
   spatial Jacobian.

**What RITK lacks relative to Elastix/SimpleITK:**
- No parameter-map–driven registration interface (RITK uses Rust struct configs, not string maps).
- No AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent optimizer (RITK has Adam, GradientDescent, Momentum, CMA-ES).
- No AdvancedMattesMutualInformation with random-coordinate sparse sampling (RITK MI uses dense Parzen histogram).
- No translation-only registration pipeline exposed at the Python level (smallest Elastix transform type).
- No Transformix-equivalent (apply saved parameter map to new image) Python API.
- No parity tests comparing RITK registration quality against Elastix reference output.
- No parameter-map serialization format (ITK .txt parameter files).

**What RITK has that is comparable:**
- `syn_register`, `multires_syn_register`, `bspline_syn_register` — diffeomorphic deformable (exceeds Elastix BSpline in deformation model expressiveness).
- `demons_register` / `diffeomorphic_demons_register` — fast deformable baseline.
- `bspline_ffd_register` — BSpline FFD control-point registration (conceptually overlaps Elastix BSpline).
- `lddmm_register` — geodesic LDDMM (exceeds Elastix’s BSpline model).
- `MutualInformation` (Mattes, Standard, NMI) in `ritk-registration/metric`.
- `AdamOptimizer`, `GradientDescentOptimizer` — adequate for rigid/affine if paired with MI.

**Minimum closure criteria:**
1. ~~Parity test suite~~ — **Closed Sprint 76**: SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod` parity tests now provide active reference baselines (translation, affine, BSpline deformable; Dice ≥ 0.80–0.85). Elastix-specific `ParameterMap`/`ElastixImageFilter` tests are not feasible on Python 3.13.
2. Gap documentation: record that RITK's deformable methods (Demons, SyN) are functionally equivalent for most Elastix BSpline use cases, but the parameter-map interface and ASGD optimizer are absent.
3. Optional full closure: implement a `ParameterMap`-driven registration façade in `ritk-python` that accepts `{"Transform": ["EulerTransform"], "Metric": ["AdvancedMattesMutualInformation"], ...}` dicts and dispatches to the appropriate RITK registration backend. This enables round-trip compatibility with Elastix parameter files.

**Severity rationale:** Low (downgraded from Medium Sprint 76) — SimpleElastix is archived and unavailable on Python 3.13. SimpleITK `ImageRegistrationMethod` parity tests now provide active reference baselines. RITK's deformable registration quality is competitive or superior to Elastix BSpline for most applications. The remaining gap is the parameter-map–driven interface and ASGD optimizer, which are convenience/API-parity items rather than correctness requirements.

## 3. Segmentation Gaps

**RITK has zero segmentation code.** The entire `segmentation` module tree is absent.

## 4. Filtering Gaps

RITK implements 4 filters. ITK implements approximately 250 image filters covering noise
reduction, edge detection, feature extraction, and bias correction.

### 4.1 N4 Bias Field Correction · Severity: **Closed** (implemented Sprint 3)

**Sprint 3 status**: `N4BiasFieldCorrectionFilter` is **implemented** in
`crates/ritk-core/src/filter/bias/`.

**Implemented:**
- Uniform cubic B-spline surface fitting via Tikhonov-regularised normal equations
  (nalgebra LU decomposition, partition-of-unity basis verified analytically)
- Wiener-deconvolution histogram sharpening in DFT domain (normalised histogram,
  concentration guard for discrete-spike inputs)
- Multi-resolution coarse-to-fine loop with control-point doubling per level
- `N4Config` with full parameter set: levels, iterations, convergence threshold,
  histogram bins, noise estimate, fitting points

**Known limitation (documented in tests):** For synthetic images with discrete
intensity levels (few distinct voxel values), the histogram sharpening step cannot
distinguish bias-induced spreading from the distribution itself. Real MRI data with
continuous Gaussian-noise-broadened tissue peaks converges correctly (verified by
`histogram_sharpen_continuous_bimodal_reduces_spread` test).

**Implemented location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/bias/`

---

### 4.2 Anisotropic Diffusion · Severity: **Closed** (implemented Sprint 3)

---

### 4.2b Gradient Magnitude / Sobel · Severity: **Closed** (implemented Sprint 3)

`GradientMagnitudeFilter` and `LaplacianFilter` implemented in
`crates/ritk-core/src/filter/edge/`. Central differences with physical spacing, one-sided
at boundaries. Both verified against exact analytical solutions.

---

### 4.3 Median Filter · Severity: **Closed** (native `Image<B,D>` implementation confirmed, Sprint 5)

Rank-order noise removal preserving edges. Removes salt-and-pepper noise without Gaussian
blurring. Used as a fast pre-step before level-set initialization.

**Sprint 5 status**: Native `Image<B,D>` implementation confirmed present in `ritk-core`.
Also exposed as `ritk.filter.median_filter` in the Python binding.
Previously mischaracterised as Python-only; the `ritk-core` `MedianFilter` operates directly
on `Image<B,D>`.

---

### 4.4 Bilateral Filter · Severity: **Closed** (native `Image<B,D>` implementation confirmed, Sprint 5)

Tomasi & Manduchi (1998). Joint spatial-range Gaussian weighting:

`BF[I](x) = (1/W(x)) Σ_p I(p) · G_σs(|x-p|) · G_σr(|I(x)-I(p)|)`

**Sprint 5 status**: Native `Image<B,D>` implementation confirmed present in `ritk-core`.

4. Double hysteresis thresholding.

Required for: initializing level-set contours, feature extraction for classical registration.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/edge/canny.rs`

### 4.6 Hessian-Based Vesselness (Frangi Filter) · Severity: **Closed** (implemented Sprint 3)

**Sprint 3 status**: `FrangiVesselnessFilter` (Frangi 1998) is **implemented** in

**Remaining:** Sato line filter, Hessian-based blob detection.

**Implemented location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/vesselness/`

---

### 4.7 Discrete and Recursive Gaussian · Severity: **Closed**

**Sprint 4 status**: `RecursiveGaussianFilter` (Deriche IIR) and `DiscreteGaussianFilter` both implemented. Parity test for recursive Gaussian added Sprint 79.

**Sprint 4 status**: `RecursiveGaussianFilter` is **implemented** in `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/recursive_gaussian.rs`. Deriche IIR 3rd-order approximation with derivative orders 0 (smoothing), 1 (first derivative), 2 (second derivative). Separable application across all 3D axes with physical spacing support.

RITK has a `GaussianFilter` but it is a single implementation. ITK separately provides:

| Filter | Algorithm | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| `DiscreteGaussianImageFilter` | Convolution with sampled Gaussian kernel | Accurate smoothing, small σ |
| `RecursiveGaussianImageFilter` | Deriche IIR approximation (Deriche 1993) | Fast large-σ smoothing, derivatives |
| `SmoothingRecursiveGaussianImageFilter` | Separable recursive Gaussian | Standard preprocessing |

The recursive variant is O(N) regardless of σ, critical for large-volume 3D MRI.
Derivatives (first, second) via recursive Gaussian are required by gradient-based registration
and Hessian-based filters.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/gaussian/` (extend existing module)

---

### 4.8 Laplacian of Gaussian / Laplacian · Severity: **Closed**

**Sprint 4 status**: `LaplacianOfGaussianFilter` implemented. Parity test added Sprint 79.

Also exposed as `ritk.filter.sobel_gradient` in the Python binding (Sprint 5).

---

### 4.10 Morphological Filters (Structuring-Element Based) · Severity: **Closed**

**Sprint 4+ status**: Grayscale erosion/dilation, white/black top-hat, hit-or-miss, label dilation/erosion/opening/closing, and morphological reconstruction all implemented in `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/morphology/`. Python bindings available.

Binary and grayscale morphological filters as standalone preprocessing operations
(distinct from the segmentation post-processing morphology in §3.6):

- Grayscale erosion / dilation (flat structuring element).
- Morphological opening / closing for artifact removal.
- Binary fill holes.
- Label dilation for label propagation.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/filter/morphology/`

## 5. Statistics & Preprocessing Gaps

### 5.1 Histogram Matching · Severity: **Closed** (implemented Sprint 27)

**Reference:** ITK `HistogramMatchingImageFilter`; SimpleITK `HistogramMatching`.

Nonlinear intensity normalization that maps the histogram of a source image to match a
reference image's histogram via piecewise-linear interpolation of quantile-quantile pairs.
Mandatory preprocessing step in every multi-atlas registration pipeline to reduce
inter-subject and inter-scanner intensity bias.

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute CDFs of source and reference images.
2. Build piecewise-linear mapping: for each quantile level `q`, map `F_src⁻¹(q)` → `F_ref⁻¹(q)`.
3. Apply mapping as a lookup table to all voxels.

**Sprint 27 status**: `HistogramMatchingFilter` is **implemented** in
`crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/histogram_matching.rs`.
CDF-based quantile-quantile piecewise-linear mapping. Exposed as `ritk.statistics.histogram_match`.
Parity-tested against SimpleITK `HistogramMatchingImageFilter` (Sprint 77, 2 parity tests pass).

**Implemented location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/histogram_matching.rs`

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/histogram_matching.rs`

**Sprint 4 status**: `NyulUdupaNormalizer` is **implemented** in `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/nyul_udupa.rs`. Two-phase train/apply with configurable percentile landmarks.

**Reference:** Nyúl & Udupa (1999), *IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging* 18(4):301–306;
Nyúl et al. (2000), *IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging* 19(2):143–150.

Piecewise-linear MRI intensity standardization. Learns landmark percentiles from a training
cohort and maps all images to a common intensity scale. The standard method for multi-site
MRI normalization in clinical studies.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/nyul_udupa.rs`

---

### 5.3 Intensity Normalization Suite · Severity: **Closed**

**Sprint 7 status**: All listed normalization methods (z-score, min-max, percentile clip, white stripe) implemented.

| Method | Formula | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Z-score | `(I - μ) / σ` | Zero-mean unit-variance normalization |
| Min-max | `(I - I_min) / (I_max - I_min)` | Rescale to [0, 1] |
| Percentile clip | Clamp to [p₁, p₉₉] then min-max | Robust to outliers |
| White stripe | Shinohara et al. (2014) — brain-specific | WM peak normalization — ✓ **Implemented** (Sprint 7) |

**Sprint 7 status**: `WhiteStripeNormalization` is **implemented** in `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/white_stripe.rs`. KDE-based white matter peak detection (Shinohara et al. 2014), 14 unit tests. Z-score, min-max, percentile-clip, and histogram matching were implemented in prior sprints.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/normalization/`

---

### 5.4 Image Statistics · Severity: **Closed**

RITK implements image-level statistics in `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/`. ITK provides:

| Statistic | Notes |
|---|---|
| Min / max / mean / variance / sum | Per image, per channel |
| Percentiles (arbitrary `p`) | Required for robust normalization |
| Masked statistics | Statistics restricted to a binary mask |
| Label statistics | Per-label min/max/mean/volume via `LabelStatisticsImageFilter` |
| Histogram | Fixed-bin or adaptive-bin 1D intensity histogram |

**Implementation status:** `image_statistics.rs`, `noise_estimation.rs`, and Python bindings implemented. `label_statistics.rs` not yet present.

**Sprint 38 note:** Python binding extraction bottleneck closed via `with_tensor_slice`. The `clone().into_data()` O(N) copy is eliminated for all read-only operations. Remaining performance gap vs SimpleITK for `compute_statistics` (2.38x) is due to sort-based percentile computation, not data extraction overhead. `compute_from_values` is public; `masked_statistics` path uses direct slice.

**Sprint 77 status**: `compute_label_intensity_statistics` is **implemented** in
`crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/label_statistics.rs`. Exposed as `ritk.statistics.compute_label_intensity_statistics`.
Parity-tested against SimpleITK `LabelStatisticsImageFilter` (per-label mean agreement < 1e-3, Sprint 77).

Used to set adaptive regularization weights and threshold parameters.

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/noise_estimation.rs`

---

### 5.6 Image Comparison Metrics · Severity: **Closed**

Distinct from registration metrics (which are differentiable losses); these are
evaluation-time quality measures:

| Metric | Formula |
|---|---|
| PSNR | `10 log₁₀(MAX²/MSE)` |
| SSIM | Structural similarity (Wang et al. 2004) |
| Dice coefficient | `2|A∩B| / (|A|+|B|)` — for segmentation evaluation |
| Hausdorff distance | `max(h(A,B), h(B,A))` |
| Average surface distance | `(1/|∂A|) Σ_{a∈∂A} d(a, ∂B)` |

**Planned location:** `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/image_comparison.rs`

**Sprint 4 status**: `psnr` (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and `ssim` (Structural Similarity, Wang et al. 2004) are now **implemented** in `crates/ritk-core/src/statistics/image_comparison.rs`. Dice, Hausdorff, and average surface distance were implemented in prior sprints.

---

## 6. IO Gaps

RITK supports DICOM, NIfTI, and PNG. Medical imaging workflows require 10+ additional formats.

### 6.0 DICOM Compressed Transfer Syntax Codec Integration · Severity: **Closed** (Sprints 53–55)

**Sprint 53**: `dicom-pixeldata 0.8` with `native` feature integrated into `ritk-io`:

- New `codec.rs` module: `pub(super) fn decode_compressed_frame` — single dispatch entry point
  for all codec-supported compressed transfer syntaxes. Calls
  `PixelDecoder::decode_pixel_data_frame`, extracts decoded bytes via `.data()`, applies the
  existing `decode_pixel_bytes` linear modality LUT (DICOM PS3.3 C.7.6.3.1.4).
- `TransferSyntaxKind::is_codec_supported()` predicate added (Sprint 53 initial set):
  - `true` for JPEG Baseline (`.50`), JPEG Lossless FOP (`.70`), RLE Lossless (`.5`).
- Compressed-TS guard relaxed in both `load_from_series` and `load_dicom_multiframe`:
  from `is_compressed()` to `is_compressed() && !is_codec_supported()`.
- `read_slice_pixels` dispatches to `codec::decode_compressed_frame` when TS is codec-supported.
- `load_dicom_multiframe` decodes each frame individually via `codec::decode_compressed_frame`
  when TS is codec-supported.

**Sprint 54**: Extended codec coverage — 5 new `TransferSyntaxKind` variants, JPEG XL feature
enabled, `is_compressed()` semantics corrected:

- Added `JpegExtended` (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.51) — JPEG Extended (Process 2 & 4), lossy 12-bit.
  Covered by existing `jpeg` feature (zero new native dependencies).
- Added `JpegLosslessNonHierarchical` (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57) — JPEG Lossless, Non-Hierarchical
  (Process 14). Covered by existing `jpeg` feature. `is_lossless()=true`.
- Enabled `jpegxl` feature of `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry` (pure Rust: `jxl-oxide` decoder +
  `zune-jpegxl` + `zune-core` encoder; no native/FFI library):
  - Added `JpegXlLossless` (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.110) — `is_lossless()=true`, `is_codec_supported()=true`.
  - Added `JpegXlJpegRecompression` (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.111) — decoder-only (`JpegXlAdapter`).
  - Added `JpegXl` (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.112) — `is_lossless()=false` (not guaranteed by TS).
- `is_compressed()` semantics corrected: `DeflatedExplicitVrLittleEndian` removed. Per DICOM PS3.5
  Table A-1, `is_compressed()` = pixel-data fragment encapsulation only; Deflated compresses the
  dataset byte-stream, not pixel fragments. All formal invariants preserved.
- `TransferSyntaxKind` now has 16 known variants; all exhaustive property tests updated.

**Current `is_codec_supported()=true` set** (8 variants, all pure Rust):
JPEG Baseline (`.50`), JPEG Extended (`.51`), JPEG Lossless NH (`.57`),
JPEG Lossless FOP (`.70`), RLE Lossless (`.5`),
JPEG XL Lossless (`.110`), JPEG XL Recompression (`.111`), JPEG XL (`.112`).

**Formal invariants verified** (exhaustive over all 16 known variants):
- `is_codec_supported() ⟹ is_compressed()` — codec path is for encapsulated TS only.
- `is_natively_supported() ⟹ !is_codec_supported()` — native and codec decode paths are disjoint.
- `is_natively_supported() ⟹ !is_compressed() ∧ !is_big_endian()` — native path soundness.
- `Output[i] = codec_sample[i] × slope + intercept` — modality LUT applied identically to both paths.
- JPEG Baseline tolerance: `|decoded[i] − original[i]| ≤ 16` (DC step ≤ 4 + AC terms + margin).
- JXL Lossless exact fidelity: `max|decoded[i] − original[i]| = 0` (ISO 18181-1 §9 modular codec).

**Remaining gaps** (require native library features):
- JPEG-LS Lossless/Near-Lossless: enable `charls` feature (C++ library) + add
  `JpegLsLossless | JpegLsLossy` to `is_codec_supported()`.
- JPEG 2000 Lossless/Lossy: enable `openjp2` or `openjpeg-sys` feature (C library) + add
  `Jpeg2000Lossless | Jpeg2000Lossy` to `is_codec_supported()`.

**Sprint 55**: Codec documentation sync, JPEG Extended round-trip test, RLE Lossless round-trip
test, CI matrix expansion to Windows and macOS:

- `codec.rs` module docstring updated: 3-codec table (Sprint 53 state) replaced with 8-codec
  table including `Feature` column. "Extension points" replaced with "Not yet supported" section
  listing correct UIDs and required C/C++ feature names. JPEG Extended tolerance contract and RLE
  Lossless exact-fidelity contract added to module docstring.
- `test_decode_compressed_frame_jpeg_extended_round_trip`: JPEG Extended (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.51)
  was `is_codec_supported()=true` but had no round-trip test. SOF0 frame under TS `.51`;
  `jpeg-decoder` handles both SOF0 and SOF1. Tolerance ≤ 16 (analytically identical to Baseline).
- `packbits_encode` + `build_rle_fragment_8bit` + `test_decode_compressed_frame_rle_lossless_round_trip`:
  RLE Lossless (1.2.840.10008.1.2.5) was `is_codec_supported()=true` but had no round-trip test.
  DICOM PackBits encoder implemented per PS3.5 Annex G.3.1–G.4.1 (64-byte RLE header + segment).
  Identified upstream `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry v0.8.2` RLE decoder off-by-one: `start=1`
  for 8-bit grayscale (should be 0), forcing `dst[0]=0` and `dst[i]=decoded_segment[i-1]` for
  i ∈ [1, N-1]. Offset-compensation proof: `original[0]=0` ∧ encode(`original[1..]`) ⟹ all
  N decoded values equal original exactly. Test exercises both repeat and literal PackBits runs.
  Lossless invariant: `max_error = 0`.
- CI `test` job matrix expanded to `[ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]`. Cache key,
  job name, and `runs-on` all parameterized on `matrix.os`. All other jobs remain Ubuntu-only.

**Sprint 56**: Native RLE Lossless decoder closes the upstream off-by-one gap:

- `packbits_decode(input, expected_len)` implements DICOM PS3.5 Annex G.3.1 (PackBits inverse):
  - `h ∈ [0,127]`: copy next `h+1` literal bytes.
  - `h = −128`: no-op.
  - `h ∈ [−127,−1]`: repeat next byte `−h+1` times.
  - Mathematical contract: `packbits_decode(packbits_encode(S), S.len()) = S` for all `S: &[u8]`.
- `decode_rle_lossless_frame` implements DICOM PS3.5 Annex G end-to-end:
  - Reads `rows`, `cols`, `samples_per_pixel` from the DICOM object.
  - Accesses fragment bytes via `Value::PixelSequence(seq).fragments()[frame_idx].to_vec()`
    (dicom-rs stores pixel fragments as `Vec<u8>`, not `PrimitiveValue`).
  - Parses 64-byte RLE header (16 × `u32` LE): segment count + segment byte offsets.
  - Decodes each byte-plane segment via `packbits_decode`.
  - Reassembles into LE pixel bytes per PS3.5 §G.5:
    `raw[p×S×B + s×B + j] = segment[s×B + (B−1−j)][p]` where `j=0` is LE LSB.
  - Correct for `bits_allocated ∈ {8, 16}` and any `samples_per_pixel`.
- `decode_compressed_frame` detects `RleLossless` via `obj.meta().transfer_syntax()` and
  dispatches to `decode_rle_lossless_frame` before invoking the upstream registry. All other
  compressed transfer syntaxes continue to use `dicom_pixeldata::PixelDecoder`.
- `test_decode_compressed_frame_rle_lossless_unrestricted_round_trip` (new): encodes all N=16
  pixels including `pixel[0] = 42`; asserts `decoded[0] == 42.0` and `max_error = 0`. This test
  FAILS with the upstream decoder and MUST pass with the native decoder.
- `test_decode_compressed_frame_rle_lossless_round_trip` (updated): changed from
  `build_rle_fragment_8bit(&original[1..])` to `build_rle_fragment_8bit(&original)` (full 16
  pixels); offset-compensation proof removed from docstring.

**Residual risk**: NONE for ritk-io. The upstream `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry v0.8.2`
off-by-one is fully bypassed by `decode_rle_lossless_frame`. Recommend filing an upstream bug
report against `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry` with the minimal reproducer from the tests.

**Tests**: Sprint 53: 11 new. Sprint 54: +22 new. Sprint 55: +2 new. Sprint 56: +1 new
(`test_decode_compressed_frame_rle_lossless_unrestricted_round_trip`). Total: **337 passed, 0 failed**.

**Implemented locations**: `crates/ritk-io/src/format/dicom/codec.rs`,
`crates/ritk-io/src/format/dicom/transfer_syntax.rs`, `reader.rs`, `multiframe.rs`,
`Cargo.toml` (workspace), `crates/ritk-io/Cargo.toml`.

**Sprint 57**: JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000 codec integration; LLVM/Clang C/C++ compiler configuration:

- Enabled `charls` feature on `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry`; added `charls = { version = "0.4", features = ["static"] }` to workspace deps for bundled static build; added `charls = { workspace = true }` to `ritk-io` deps for Cargo feature unification.
- Enabled `openjpeg-sys` feature on `dicom-transfer-syntax-registry`; added `openjpeg-sys = "1.0"` to workspace deps; added `openjpeg-sys = { workspace = true }` to `ritk-io` dev-dependencies.
- Added `[env]` section to `.cargo/config.toml` with target-specific clang/clang-cl vars (`force = false`); updated CI to install LLVM/Clang on all three OS matrices (Linux, macOS, Windows via Chocolatey).
- Added `JpegLsLossless`, `JpegLsLossy`, `Jpeg2000Lossless`, `Jpeg2000Lossy` to `is_codec_supported()`; updated `is_codec_supported()` doc comment (removed "Not yet supported" section, added charls/OpenJPEG rows to table); updated `codec.rs` doc table with JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000 rows.
- `test_decode_compressed_frame_jpegls_lossless_round_trip`: full round-trip via CharLS encode → DICOM → `decode_compressed_frame`; asserts `max_error = 0.0` (ISO 14495-1 NEAR=0 invariant).
- `test_decode_compressed_frame_jpegls_near_lossless_round_trip`: near-lossless round-trip with NEAR=2; asserts `max_error ≤ 2.0` (ISO 14495-1 analytical bound).

**Tests**: Sprint 53: 11 new. Sprint 54: +22 new. Sprint 55: +2 new. Sprint 56: +1 new. Sprint 57: +2 new (`test_decode_compressed_frame_jpegls_lossless_round_trip`, `test_decode_compressed_frame_jpegls_near_lossless_round_trip`). Sprint 58: +2 new (`write_jpeg2000_lossless_dicom_file` helper, `test_decode_compressed_frame_jpeg2000_lossless_round_trip`). Total: **341 passed, 0 failed**.

**Residual risk (Sprint 57)**: JPEG 2000 round-trip test deferred — no pure-Rust JPEG 2000 encoder; `jpeg2k` crate is decode-only. Full round-trip requires openjpeg-sys FFI encoding. **Closed Sprint 58**: `write_jpeg2000_lossless_dicom_file` helper implemented via openjpeg-sys FFI (`OPJ_CODEC_J2K`, `irreversible=0`, `numresolution=1`); full round-trip test verifies ISO 15444-1 §C.5.5.1 lossless invariant (max_error = 0.0).

## 7. Python Binding Gaps

### 7.1 Python Bindings — Sprint 83 Updated · Severity: **Low** (was Medium → High; one operational gap remains: hosted-CI maturin matrix validation)

`ritk-python` is a PyO3 0.22 native extension (`cdylib`) with six submodules.
`abi3-py39` enables CPython 3.9–3.14 compatibility without recompilation.
Sprint 3 added 8 new functions to `ritk.filter` and 3 new functions to `ritk.registration`.
Sprint 5 expanded `ritk.filter` to 14 functions and `ritk.segmentation` to 16 functions,
providing full coverage of all implemented ritk-core segmentation and filter algorithms.
Sprint 6 expanded `ritk.registration` from 4 → 8 functions: added `bspline_ffd_register`,
`multires_syn_register`, `bspline_syn_register`, `lddmm_register`.
Sprint 7 added `ritk.statistics` submodule with 13 functions: image statistics, comparison
metrics (Dice, Hausdorff, mean surface distance, PSNR, SSIM), normalization (z-score, min-max,
histogram matching, Nyúl-Udupa), and white stripe normalization.

Remaining gaps relative to SimpleITK / ANTsPy:
- No `maturin develop` / wheel publish workflow verified end-to-end on hosted CI runners (Sprint 33 configured `python_ci.yml` with a build-wheel-and-reinstall path; requires matrix-runner execution to confirm all OS/Python combinations). All other prior gaps closed: transform I/O (Sprint 8), type stubs (Sprint 31, `__init__.pyi` present), `py.allow_threads` (Sprint 82 segmentation/statistics + Sprint 83 `recursive_gaussian`), atlas/JLF Python API (Sprint 8).

```

**Remaining work:**
- Run `maturin develop` end-to-end in CI on all matrix OS/Python targets (GitHub Actions `python_ci.yml` matrix is configured; requires CI runner execution to confirm end-to-end).
- Add integration test comparing `ritk.io.read_image` output against SimpleITK reference values when SimpleITK is available in the CI environment.

### 7.4 CLI Tooling Gaps · Severity: **Medium**

ANTs ships ~40 command-line executables (`antsRegistration`, `N4BiasFieldCorrection`,
`antsBrainExtraction.sh`, etc.). SimpleITK ships utility CLIs via `SimpleITK` Python module.
RITK has no CLI layer.

**Sprint 21:** `multires-demons` method added to `crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/register.rs` with `--levels` (usize, default 3) and `--use-diffeomorphic` (flag) args. 2 new CLI tests added.

**Sprint 28/29:** `ic-demons` method added to `crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/register.rs` (`--inverse-consistency-weight`, `--n-squarings` args). 2 value-semantic CLI tests pass.

**Planned location:**
```

## 9. Architecture Plan for New Modules

All new modules follow RITK's confirmed conventions:
- DIP: trait in `mod.rs` of parent; concrete impl in child `*.rs` file.
- Files ≤ 400 lines; split by responsibility, not size alone.
- Naming: domain-relevant, no `utils.rs`, no `helpers/`.
- No API names encoding bounded variation dimensions (no `filter_f32`, `register_cpu`).
