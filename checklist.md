      exact native-vs-legacy and reader/writer contract coverage.
- [x] Verify provider nextest 32/32, combined nextest 397/397, warning-denied
      Clippy, doctests, rustdoc, and migration audit reduction to 19 manifests
      and 590 source files with only the known displacement-field drift.
- [x] Commit, push, and advance the RITK gitlink in the stack repository.

## MIG-507-01 — TIFF Burn boundary deletion
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Promote grayscale multipage reader/writer and RGB multipage reader to
      canonical native image and native color-volume contracts.
- [x] Delete Burn-specific provider implementations, transitional modules,
      direct `burn-ndarray`/`ritk-core` dependencies, and differential-only
      fixtures while retaining exact format and failure coverage.
- [x] Replace metadata-sized eager reader reservation with fallible growth
      after each page is decoded and validated; add checked writer products and
      `u32` dimension conversions.
- [x] Localize the remaining legacy storage conversion in `ritk-io` and route
      native reader/writer adapters through canonical provider APIs.
- [x] Verify provider nextest 13/13 and combined nextest 378/378; all-target
      compilation; warning-denied Clippy; doctests with four existing ignored
      networking examples; warning-clean rustdoc.
- [x] Confirm the migration audit drops to 20 manifests and 591 source files,
      with no TIFF residue or cleanup candidates and only the pre-existing
      displacement-field drift.
- [x] Commit, push, and advance the Atlas RITK gitlink.

## MIG-506-01 — PNG Burn boundary deletion
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Promote single-slice, natural-sorted grayscale series, RGB slice, and RGB
      series readers to canonical Coeus-backed APIs using native image and
      native color-volume contracts.
- [x] Delete `ritk-png`'s Burn implementations, transitional module, direct
      `burn-ndarray`/`ritk-core` dependencies, and differential-only fixtures.
- [x] Replace eager directory-size-amplified reservations with fallible
      per-decoded-image growth while retaining dimension mismatch rejection.
- [x] Localize the remaining legacy storage conversion in `ritk-io` and route
      its native reader adapters directly through the canonical provider APIs.
- [x] Verify all targets; provider nextest 8/8; combined nextest 373/373;
      warning-denied Clippy; doctests with four existing ignored networking
      examples; warning-clean rustdoc.
- [x] Confirm the migration audit drops to 21 manifests and 595 source files.
      The native color-volume file is allowlisted only because the lexical
      scanner treats Coeus `Tensor<T, B>` as a Burn token; the sole real drift
      remains the pre-existing displacement-field module.
- [x] Commit, push, and advance the Atlas RITK gitlink.

## MIG-505-01 — JPEG Burn boundary deletion
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Verify grayscale native decoding/encoding already shares the real JPEG
      codec cores and identify RGB as the remaining provider-only Burn API.
- [x] Promote borrowed/backend-native grayscale and RGB APIs to canonical root
      names; delete Burn types, transitional modules, and direct Burn/core
      dependencies from `ritk-jpeg`.
- [x] Add the missing native `ColorVolume<T, B, C>` provider type in
      `ritk-image`; preserve three-dimensional physical metadata while the
      compile-time channel count controls rank-4 interleaved storage.
- [x] Move only the still-required legacy image conversion to `ritk-io`, whose
      CLI consumers remain Burn-typed; update native adapters to canonical APIs.
- [x] Verify all targets; focused JPEG nextest 12/12; `ritk-jpeg` nextest 6/6;
      combined package nextest 411/411; warning-denied Clippy; doctests with
      five existing ignored examples; warning-clean rustdoc.
- [x] Confirm the migration audit drops to 22 manifests and 596 source files,
      with no JPEG entries or cleanup candidates. Its sole failure remains the
      pre-existing displacement-field module drift.
- [x] Commit, push, and advance the Atlas RITK gitlink.

## MIG-504-01 — Burn allowlist cleanup
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Remove the 18 exact cleanup candidates emitted by the authoritative Burn
      migration audit; change no production source or manifest.
- [x] Rerun the audit and confirm zero cleanup candidates remain.
- [x] Keep the live displacement-field module unallowlisted; the audit remains
      red with that single pre-existing drift as an explicit migration gate.
- [x] Commit, push, and advance the Atlas RITK gitlink.

## MIG-503-01 — Native integer translation registration
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Verify RITK has no canonical integer-voxel SSD/NCC translation search
      and confirm the required generic scalar operations in Eunomia.
- [x] Add one allocation-free borrowed-volume search kernel with sealed metric
      ZSTs, native-precision reductions, checked shapes, and typed failures.
- [x] Port exact shift recovery across f32/f64 and both metrics; add invalid
      shape, non-finite input, constant-volume, and identity coverage.
- [x] Complete package nextest 745/745, warning-denied Clippy, doctests 3/3
      with 14 existing ignored examples, and warning-clean rustdoc. The Burn
      audit remains red on the pre-existing displacement-field drift and 18
      unrelated cleanup candidates; this slice adds no Burn surface.
- [x] Commit and push RITK, then advance the Atlas gitlink without touching the
      dirty original RITK or Helios worktrees.

## MIG-502-01 — MINC Burn boundary deletion
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Verify the MINC decode/encode cores and all production consumers already
      have native Coeus boundaries.
- [x] Delete the Burn reader, writer, device wrappers, differential fixtures,
      transitional `native` modules, and direct `burn-ndarray` dependency.
- [x] Promote native MINC adapters to their final `ritk-minc`/`ritk-io` paths.
- [x] Complete gates: nextest 405/405; workspace all-target check clean;
      all-target/all-feature Clippy warning-clean; rustdoc clean; doctests have
      four existing ignored networking examples and no failures. Burn audit
      confirms 23 manifests and no MINC entries, but remains red on unrelated
      pre-existing `ritk-transform` allowlist drift from commit `e75d8748`.
- [x] Commit and push the RITK increment; advance the Atlas gitlink in the
      integration repository.

## MIG-501-01 — Native brain-mask operation boundaries
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure

- [x] Consolidate legacy connected-component dispatch onto one flat-buffer
      owner and expose a native Coeus image boundary with exact statistics.
- [x] Expose native inclusive thresholding and binary hole filling by calling
      the existing canonical flat-buffer cores; retain no compatibility API.
- [x] Add exact value and metadata tests, including Burn differential hole-fill
      coverage. Evidence: native-focused nextest 24/24; package nextest
      1405/1405; all-target/all-feature Clippy warning-clean; doctests 2/2
      passed with 11 existing ignored examples; rustdoc warning-clean.
- [ ] Convert registration `ct_brain_mask` and every caller to these native
      boundaries, then delete the corresponding Burn consumer surface.

## MIG-500-01 — Reject hidden Burn dependency relocation
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Blocked; reopen when consumers are ported to Coeus-native APIs

- [x] Audit the 112-file dependency cleanup and run the strongest available
      gates: workspace all-target compile, workspace Clippy with warnings
      denied, migration audit, and nextest 4901/4901 all pass.
- [x] Reject completion: the diff removes direct `burn-ndarray` declarations by
      adding/reusing Burn re-exports in `ritk-image` and `ritk-wgpu-compat`.
      This relocates the dependency behind compatibility aliases and does not
      port consumers to Coeus.
- [ ] Replace each affected consumer with its native Coeus/Leto operation,
      delete the Burn aliases, refresh the allowlist only after real source
      removal, and rerun the same gates.

## MIG-499-01 — Canonical native binary erosion
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Plan (MIG-499-01)
- [x] Delete the unused prefixed binary-erosion type and its module exports.
      Completion condition: the duplicate state, default, boundary marshalling,
      and copied host extraction no longer exist.
- [x] Move its seven exact semantic regressions to
      `morphology::native::binary_erode` and add a bounded-exhaustive oracle.
      Completion condition: every binary 2x2x3 input is checked for radii 0
      through 2 against an independent erosion implementation.
- [x] Synchronize stale documentation and run the package gates. Completion
      condition: formatting, clippy, nextest, doctests, and rustdoc are clean,
      and no source or current PM reference names the deleted surface.

### Evidence
- [x] Focused native erosion nextest: 8/8 passed, including 12,288
      bounded-exhaustive core comparisons over all binary 2x2x3 volumes and
      radii 0 through 2.
- [x] `ritk-filter` package nextest: 966/966 passed in 14.020 seconds.
- [x] `ritk-filter` all-target/all-feature clippy passed with warnings denied;
      doctests passed 2/2 with 11 intentionally ignored; `ritk-filter` and
      `ritk-registration` all-feature rustdoc completed without warnings.
- [x] Exact-file rustfmt and deleted-surface static audit passed. The
      package-wide fmt check remains blocked only by unrelated pre-existing
      formatting drift in `intensity/arithmetic/unary.rs`.

### Residual scope
- Burn consumer cutover in registration and both Snap dispatchers is a separate
  coordinated slice because one Snap dispatcher contains unrelated local work.

## DEP-498-01 — `ritk-spatial` Burn Module/Record Removal
**Target version**: 0.14.0 migration batch (breaking legacy Burn-trait impl removal)
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (DEP-498-01)
- [x] Remove `ritk-spatial`'s crate-local Burn alias module and delete the
      `burn` manifest dependency. Completion condition: `crates/ritk-spatial`
      no longer exposes `crate::burn` or depends on Burn.
- [x] Delete Burn `Record`, `Module`, `AutodiffModule`, and display impls from
      `Vector`, `Point`, `Direction`, and `Spacing`. Completion condition: the
      geometry value API stays intact while legacy Burn serialization hooks are
      absent.
- [x] Verify the bounded slice. Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p
      ritk-spatial --check` passed; `rustup run nightly cargo check -p
      ritk-spatial` passed; `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p
      ritk-spatial --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 40/40; `rg -n
      "Burn|burn|ModuleDisplay|AutodiffModule|Record<|crate::burn"
      crates\ritk-spatial` returns no matches; `rustup run nightly cargo tree
      -p ritk-spatial -i burn` reports no matching `burn` package.

### Residual risk (gap_audit.md candidates)
- The broader workspace still contains Burn/Burn-ndarray manifest lines outside
  `ritk-spatial`; this slice closes only the spatial value-type hook.

## DEP-497-01 — Dead `burn` production-dep strip (17 leaf crates)
**Target version**: 0.14.0 (no bump — dependency-only, no public API change)
**Sprint phase**: Closed 2026-07-07 (commit `7a66d1ee`)

### Completed plan (DEP-497-01)
- [x] Remove `burn = { workspace = true }` production dependency from
      `ritk-{cli,core,filter,io,jpeg,metaimage,mgh,minc,model,nifti,nrrd,
      png,registration,segmentation,snap,statistics,tiff,transform,vtk}`
      Cargo.toml where sub-batch #3 per-crate ports (`.a`-`.f`) already
      removed the last production-code reference. `burn-ndarray` dev-dep
      retained where per-crate sub-batch #3 test ports are still open —
      this is explicitly distinct from sub-batch #5's full Burn Cargo
      strip + `Image<B, D>` re-export switch per
      `docs/adr/0012-ritk-burn-trait-rebind.md` §Decision §Sub-batch #5
      (no `[dependencies]` rename/`burn-ndarray` removal here, no
      version bump).
- [x] Fix a `clippy::doc_lazy_continuation` false trigger in
      `ritk-model/src/ssmmorph/encoder/tests.rs` (leading `+` parsed as
      a markdown list marker by rustdoc) surfaced while verifying this
      slice; `cargo fmt` run across the 19 touched crates.
      Completion condition: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --
      -D warnings` returns 0 warnings.
- [x] Run the full verification gate. Evidence: `rustup run nightly
      cargo nextest run -p ritk-{cli,core,filter,io,jpeg,metaimage,mgh,
      minc,model,nifti,nrrd,png,registration,segmentation,snap,
      statistics,tiff,transform,vtk} --no-fail-fast` passed 4258/4258
      (23 skipped); `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D
      warnings` clean; `cargo fmt --check` clean for touched crates
      (pre-existing `xtask/src/migration_audit.rs` drift left
      untouched — out of scope for this slice); `cargo doc --no-deps`
      generated no new warnings (2 pre-existing private intra-doc links
      predated that change and were later closed by MIG-499-01).
- [x] Verified full-workspace `cargo nextest run --workspace` in
      isolation reproduces an unrelated pre-existing timeout in
      `ritk-snap app::pacs_ops::tests::handle_submit_retrieve_series_
      sets_pending_state` only under full-workspace parallel resource
      contention (passes in 2.1s when run scoped/isolated); the file
      is untouched by this diff — filed as residual risk, not blocking.

### Residual risk (gap_audit.md candidates)
- Closed by MIG-499-01: the 2 pre-existing private intra-doc links were removed
  with the redundant erosion surface and the Euclidean native-doc correction.
- `ritk-snap::app::pacs_ops` full-workspace-nextest-only timeout is
  resource-contention flakiness under full-parallel load, not a code
  hang (isolated run: 2.1s pass) — worth a nextest per-binary
  parallelism cap if it recurs, not a correctness defect.

## MIG-496-07 — DICOM Dimension Overflow Guard
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (MIG-496-07)
- [x] Port PR #4's DICOM size guard into the current scalar series loader.
      Completion condition: `rows * cols` and frame-counted volume allocation
      sizes fail with typed errors before decode or allocation.
- [x] Add local value-semantic regressions for frame and volume count overflow.
      Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-io
      load_from_series_rejects --no-fail-fast` passed 2/2.
- [x] Run the focused loader verification slice. Evidence:
      `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p ritk-io --check`,
      `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-io
      format::dicom::reader::tests::load_transfer --no-fail-fast` passed 5/5,
      and `rustup run nightly cargo clippy -p ritk-io --tests -- -D warnings`
      passed.

## MIG-496-06 — NIfTI Int16 Decode Coverage
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (MIG-496-06)
- [x] Add signed 16-bit NIfTI datatype support to the header codec. Completion
      condition: datatype code 4 validates with 16-bit payload lanes and image
      voxels sign-extend into the reader scalar path.
- [x] Preserve value semantics with a synthetic in-memory regression. Evidence:
      `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-nifti
      read_nifti_from_bytes_accepts_int16_voxels --status-level fail
      --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1.
- [x] Re-run the downstream loader failure and the broader selected package
      gate. Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-snap
      test_load_nifti_volume_shape --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed
      1/1, and the selected RITK package gate passed 4305/4305 with 26 skipped.

## DEP-496-04 — DICOM Attribute Ownership
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (DEP-496-04)
- [x] Add `ritk-dicom` typed tag vocabulary. Completion condition: consumers
      can refer to DICOM image tags through RITK-owned constants.
- [x] Add `DicomAttributeRead` over parsed backend objects. Completion
      condition: required/optional unsigned scalars, decimal scalars,
      multi-valued decimal vectors, and transfer-syntax UID reads are available
      without importing dicom-rs APIs downstream.
- [x] Verify upstream and downstream behavior. Evidence:
      `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-dicom attribute
      --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 2/2, and Helios
      `helios-domain/dicom` nextest passed 5/5 through the new surface.

## MIG-496-05 — Analyze Burn Dependency Deletion
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (MIG-496-05)
- [x] Remove stale `burn` and `burn-ndarray` manifest edges from
      `crates/ritk-analyze`. Completion condition: `burn-migration-audit`
      reports 26 Burn manifests instead of the prior 27 and no active
      `ritk-analyze` Burn source surface.
- [x] Make the Analyze crate root native-only. Completion condition:
      `read_analyze`/`write_analyze` and `AnalyzeReader`/`AnalyzeWriter`
      operate on `ritk_image::native::Image<f32, B, 3>`.
- [x] Move the remaining Analyze Burn compatibility bridge to `ritk-io`, the
      consumer boundary that still serves legacy Burn-typed CLI/Python paths.
- [x] Refresh `xtask/burn_surface.allowlist` with the new
      `refresh-burn-allowlist` flow and rerun `burn-migration-audit`.
      Evidence: audit status clean; manifest count is 26 and source-file
      count is 670 after the real deletion.
- [x] Preserve Analyze parity under nextest. Evidence:
      `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-analyze --status-level
      fail --no-fail-fast` passed 4/4, and `rustup run nightly cargo nextest
      run -p ritk-analyze -p ritk-io native_analyze_reader_matches_burn
      --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1.
- [x] Run focused compile/format gates. Evidence:
      `rustup run nightly cargo check -p ritk-analyze -p ritk-io --lib`
      passed, and `rustup run nightly cargo fmt --check -p ritk-analyze
      -p ritk-io` passed.

## MIG-496-04 — Python Native Image I/O Cutover
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (MIG-496-04)
- [x] Add a shared `ritk-io` native image dispatch surface over the existing
      native `ImageReader`/`ImageWriter` adapters. Completion condition:
      `read_image_native`/`write_image_native` select native readers/writers
      for every currently native-capable `ImageFormat`.
- [x] Route `crates/ritk-python` `read_image`/`write_image` through that
      shared native dispatch and remove the Python I/O module's direct
      Burn `NdArrayDevice` construction.
- [x] Add value-semantic Python coverage for NRRD/NIfTI native round trips and
      explicit VTK rejection while VTK lacks a native image writer.
- [x] Remove residual unused imports and the dead local scalar constructor left
      by the Python native image cutover. Completion condition: the PyO3 crate
      compiles without warnings.
- [x] Run focused Rust gates. Evidence: `rustup run nightly cargo fmt -p
      ritk-python --check` passed; `rustup run nightly cargo check -p
      ritk-python` passed; `rustup run nightly cargo clippy -p ritk-python
      --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed; `rustup run nightly cargo nextest
      run -p ritk-python --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 47/47.

### Residual risk (gap_audit.md candidates)
- The Python processing surface still contains 54 `crates/ritk-python/src`
  files with Burn bridge symbols (`burn_into_py_image`, `py_image_to_burn`,
  `BurnBackend`, `BurnImage`, `burn_ndarray`, or `burn::`). This slice closes
  native image I/O plus warning hygiene, not full Python filter/segmentation
  Burn removal.

## ADR-0003-02 — CLI Native Loading Cutover
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### Completed plan (ADR-0003-02)
- [x] Route native-readable shared CLI loads through native readers. Completion
      condition: `read_image` uses `read_image_native` for NIfTI, MetaImage,
      NRRD, PNG, DICOM, MGH, TIFF, JPEG, and Analyze; VTK remains the only
      Burn read fallback because `ritk-io` has no native VTK reader.
- [x] Add an explicit boundary bridge for unmigrated Burn-typed command
      consumers. Completion condition: `native_image_to_burn` preserves shape,
      origin, spacing, direction, and voxel values in a value-semantic test.
- [x] Move the CLI viewer DICOM load to the native metadata-rich reader.
      Completion condition: `viewer.rs` calls
      `load_native_dicom_series_with_metadata`, then bridges into the current
      Burn-typed `ritk-snap` core.
- [x] Preserve behavior with value-semantic coverage. Verification:
      `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-cli dicom --status-level
      fail --no-fail-fast` passed 5/5, and `rustup run nightly cargo nextest
      run -p ritk-cli native --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 6/6.
- [x] Run touched-file formatting evidence. `rustup run nightly rustfmt
      --check crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/mod.rs
      crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/viewer.rs
      crates/ritk-cli/src/commands/convert.rs` passed.

## MIG-433-06 — Registration Native N4 Preprocessing
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### In-flight plan (MIG-433-06)
- [x] Extract the N4 algorithm from the Burn image wrapper into the
      backend-neutral `ritk_filter::bias::apply_n4_bias_correction_values`
      SSOT. Completion condition: the Burn `N4BiasFieldCorrectionFilter`
      delegates to the value helper instead of owning a parallel algorithm.
- [x] Route `PreprocessingPipeline::execute_native` `N4BiasCorrection` through
      the value helper and rebuild the native Coeus image with source
      origin/spacing/direction preserved.
- [x] Add value-semantic coverage for the native executor. Completion
      condition: native N4 executor output exactly matches the N4 value SSOT
      for the same buffer and metadata is preserved.
- [x] Add boundary coverage for the new value helper. Completion condition:
      shape/value-count mismatch returns the exact typed error in the committed
      regression test.
- [x] Run focused registration nextest evidence. `rustup run nightly cargo
      nextest run -p ritk-registration preprocessing --status-level fail
      --no-fail-fast` passed 20/20.
- [x] Re-run focused filter N4 nextest after sibling provider repair. The
      `coeus-core`/`leto-ops` `E0034` ambiguity cleared upstream without a
      RITK-side change; `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter
      n4 --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 10/10 (post-add,
      including the value-helper length-regression test).
- [x] Run touched-file formatting evidence. `rustup run nightly rustfmt --check
      crates/ritk-filter/src/bias/n4/mod.rs
      crates/ritk-filter/src/bias/n4/tests_n4.rs
      crates/ritk-filter/src/bias/mod.rs
      crates/ritk-registration/src/preprocessing/native_executor.rs` passed.
- [x] Clear package clippy/doc gates after sibling provider repair. Evidence:
      `cargo clippy -p ritk-registration --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean,
      `cargo test --doc -p ritk-registration` passed 3/3 (14 ignored), `cargo
      doc -p ritk-registration --no-deps` clean.

## PERF-432-01 — B-spline Registration Hot Path
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice

### In-flight plan (PERF-432-01)
- [x] Confirmed the requested `--features coeus` gate is stale:
      `ritk-registration` no longer defines a `coeus` feature.
- [x] Re-ran the focused row on the current crate graph without the removed
      feature flag. Baseline: `bspline_registers_offset_sphere` passed in
      67.991s, still over the 30s nextest slow threshold.
- [x] Implemented the bounded production optimization in
      `crates/ritk-transform/src/transform/bspline/interpolation/dim3.rs`:
      small 3-D control lattices use a dense support matrix plus matmul instead
      of repeated coefficient gather/select; larger matrices keep the sparse
      gather path.
- [x] Verify the optimized focused row once the local dependency graph compiles.
      Completion condition: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p
      ritk-registration bspline_registers_offset_sphere --status-level all
      --no-fail-fast` passes and reports the test under 30s. Evidence: the
      `coeus-core`/`leto-ops` `E0034` ambiguity cleared upstream (no RITK
      change needed); the focused row now passes in **17.279s**.
- [x] Run the package-scoped gate once the local dependency graph compiles.
      Completion condition: `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p
      ritk-registration --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passes; do not use
      the removed `--features coeus` flag. Evidence: 740/740 passed (23
      skipped) in 67.7s wall clock; `cargo clippy -p ritk-registration
      --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo test --doc -p
      ritk-registration` passed 3/3 (14 ignored); `cargo doc -p
      ritk-registration --no-deps` clean.

### Resolved blocker
- `rustup run nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-registration
  bspline_registers_offset_sphere --status-level all --no-fail-fast` had
  failed before `ritk-registration` built because local path dependencies
  `coeus-core` and `leto-ops` emitted `E0034` ambiguity errors for
  `from_f64`/`from_usize` after Eunomia numeric trait methods entered scope.
  Re-checked this pass: `coeus-core`/`leto-ops` now compile clean without any
  RITK-side change — the ambiguity was resolved upstream in those repos.

## Atlas consumer integration — Burn GPU default removal
- [x] [patch] Remove RITK's unused workspace-level `dicom/ndarray` feature
      selection. `ritk-dicom` owns pixel decoding through its explicit
      `dicom-pixeldata` dependency and uses the aggregate `dicom` crate for
      object parsing only. Completion condition: `ritk-dicom` check/nextest
      stay green, and the downstream Helios `helios-domain/dicom` feature tree
      no longer selects aggregate `dicom` feature flags for `ndarray` or
      `pixeldata`.
- [x] [patch] Remove the workspace-level Burn WGPU default: change RITK's
      workspace Burn feature set from `wgpu,autodiff` to
      `std,ndarray,autodiff`, and make
      `ritk_registration::deformable_field_ops::CpuOrGpu` default to
      `burn::backend::NdArray`. Completion condition: consumers can compile
      through RITK without inheriting Burn's WGPU backend unless they
      explicitly select a GPU backend. Verification: downstream kwavers
      `rustup run nightly cargo check -p kwavers --features pinn` passed, and
      the selected kwavers dependency tree contains no `burn-wgpu`,
      `burn-cuda`, or `burn-rocm`.
- [x] [patch] Add native DICOM series loading: factor RITK DICOM series
      loading so decoded voxels plus `Point`/`Spacing`/`Direction` metadata
      feed both the legacy Burn image constructor and native
      `ritk_image::native::Image::from_flat_on`. Completion condition:
      metadata-rich DICOM loading and the public `DicomSeriesInfo` facade both
      have native Coeus-backed entry points, Burn/native parity tests compare
      decoded voxels and spatial metadata, and downstream `kwavers-imaging`
      can remove its direct Burn DICOM bridge. Verification: `rustup run
      nightly cargo check -p ritk-io` passed; focused `rustup run nightly
      cargo nextest run -p ritk-io native_dicom_loader_matches_legacy_loader
      --status-level fail --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1; focused `rustup run
      nightly cargo nextest run -p ritk-io
      native_series_loader_matches_legacy_loader --status-level fail
      --no-fail-fast` passed 1/1; downstream `rustup run nightly cargo check
      -p kwavers-imaging` passed; downstream focused `rustup run nightly cargo
      nextest run -p kwavers-imaging dicom --status-level fail --no-fail-fast`
      passed 14/14.

## Atlas Batch #3 — RITK Atlas-typed parallel trait surface (Sub-batch #1 of ritual Burn-trait rebind)

**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice (2026-07-06)

### Completed plan (Atlas Batch #3 Sub-batch #1, additive)
- [x] [patch] **RITK-Atlas-typed-trait-surface (Additive)** — Add parallel Atlas-typed
      trait surface (`TransformAtlas<T, B, D>`, `InterpolatorAtlas<T, B>`,
      `ResampleableAtlas<T, B, D>`) ALONGSIDE the Burn-keyed legacy
      `Transform<B, D>`, `Interpolator<B>`, `Resampleable<B, D>`; traits are
      default-bodied with no concrete impls on day 1, so legacy surface is
      untouched. Add `pub use native::Image as AtlasImage;` re-export in
      `ritk-image/src/lib.rs` so `ritk_image::AtlasImage<T, B, D>` resolves
      cross-crate through the Atlas substrate carrier already at
      `ritk-image/src/native.rs:18-25`. Add `coeus-core = { workspace = true }`
      and `coeus-tensor = { workspace = true }` to `ritk-core/Cargo.toml`
      (`[dependencies]`) — both are workspace-declared at
      `ritk/Cargo.toml:78-79`. Completion condition: purely additive; no public
      Burn-keyed surface symbol removed/narrowed/renamed; `xtask/burn_surface.allowlist`
      unchanged; Burn GPU-default drift (closed in inner commit `65a1a0fd`)
      preserved.
- Evidence tier: lexical + cross-crate dep-graph + cargo check of touched
      packages. Sub-batch #1 is the additive foundation for sub-batches #2-#6
      (RITK-trait-deprecate, RITK-crate-migrate, RITK-spatial-rebind,
      RITK-burn-remove, RITK-xtask-ci) per
      `atlas/docs/adr/0012-ritk-burn-trait-rebind.md` §Decision.
- Reserved inner tag: `ritk/atlas-migration-push/batch3` per ADR 0010
      §Decision §"Per-batch name pattern".

## Atlas Batch #3 — RITK Atlas trait soft deprecation documentation (Sub-batch #2 of ritual Burn-trait rebind)

**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure complete for this slice (2026-07-06)

### Completed plan (Atlas Batch #3 Sub-batch #2, docstring-only)
- [x] [patch] **RITK-trait-deprecate (Docstring-only soft deprecation)** — appended
      soft docstring deprecation callout to the four Burn-keyed foundational surfaces:
      `Transform<B, D>`, `Resampleable<B, D>`, `Interpolator<B>`, and `Image<B, D>`.
      Each callout (a) uses a bold-prefixed lead sentence that promotes the Atlas-typed
      parallel trait (`TransformAtlas` / `ResampleableAtlas` / `InterpolatorAtlas` /
      `AtlasImage`) as the forward path; (b) explicitly notes that NO
      `#[deprecated]` attribute is applied to avoid cascading 671-file
      `#[warn(deprecated)]` compile warnings; (c) cross-references
      `atlas/docs/adr/0012-ritk-burn-trait-rebind.md` §Sub-batch #2 for the migration
      plan; and (d) cross-references `xtask/burn_surface.allowlist` so consumer crates
      reading the deprecation can locate the source of the legacy surface contract.
      **Zero functional change**: `cargo check -p ritk-core -p ritk-image` passes with
      no warnings; `cargo doc -p ritk-core -p ritk-image --no-deps` intra-doc-link
      resolution confirms the forward-pointing intra-doc-links ([`TransformAtlas`],
      [`ResampleableAtlas`], [`InterpolatorAtlas`], [`AtlasImage`]) resolve correctly.
- Evidence tier: cargo check + cargo doc (intra-doc-link resolution) + cargo tree.
      No public Burn-keyed surface symbol is removed, narrowed, renamed, or
      re-exported-differently. `xtask/burn_surface.allowlist` is unchanged because
      the auto-generated allowlist is signature-keyed (not docstring-keyed); the
      legacy symbols still exist in the source and the parallel Atlas signatures are
      purely additive (per sub-batch #1 closure). The Burn GPU-default drift
      (closed in inner commit `65a1a0fd`) is preserved.
- Forward intent: the soft-deprecation hint is a compiler-quiet migration signal for
      the next [minor] sub-batch (#3 = per-crate Atlas-typed migration) — consumer
      crates reading rustdoc or rust-analyzer hover on these surfaces will see the
      Atlas-typed callout at zero compile-cost.
- Atomic-boundary discipline preserved: sub-batch #2 is purely subtractive-by-
      documentation; no additive trait surface, no `Cargo.toml` mutation, no
      allowlist regeneration. Sub-batches #1 (additive parallel traits) and #2
      (docstring deprecation) are deliberately separate commits per the ADR 0012
      §Decision atomic-boundary discipline.
- Reserved inner tag: `ritk/atlas-migration-push/batch3` per ADR 0010
      §Decision §"Per-batch name pattern".

## Sprint 495 — MIG-495: Native Writers for the Remaining 5 Formats
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — all-format native I/O parity

### In-flight plan (Sprint 495)
- [x] Surveyed the 5 Burn writers: all extract host data then serialize from a
  flat slice + metadata; minc already had a `write_minc2_hdf5` core.
- [x] Extracted a substrate-agnostic serialization core per format
  (`write_*_flat`/`*_stream`); Burn + native writers wrap it. Native writers
  use `data_cow_on` for layout-independent host extraction.
- [x] Merged each crate's reader+writer `native` modules into one crate-root
  `native` facade.
- [x] ritk-io: native `{Mgh,MetaImage,Minc,Tiff,Jpeg}Writer` implementing the
  unified `ImageWriter<Image<f32,B,3>>` contract (arg order per crate).
- [x] Tests: io writer→reader contract round-trips (4 lossless) + jpeg
  byte-identical native-vs-Burn oracle.
- [x] Gates: mgh 32, metaimage 23, minc 43, tiff 17, jpeg 11, io 360; clippy
  -D warnings + doc clean; upstream (moirai) WIP waited out.

### Verification gate (Sprint 495)
- [x] All 9 formats now read AND write natively via the unified contract.
- [x] Burn-path behavior unchanged (refactor-in-place).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- The cli/python native cutover [major] (needs ADR) — now the only remaining
  blocker before Burn can be deleted from the format crates and the SSOT
  token counts fall.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, MI/Parzen 3rd metric,
  driver early-stop; coeus gaps (multi-D FFT wrapper, gather/scatter autograd).


## Sprint 494 — MIG-494: Native Writers for NRRD + Analyze
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — completing the native I/O vertical for two formats

### In-flight plan (Sprint 494)
- [x] Audited native-writer parity: only nifti had a native writer; 8 formats
  were Burn-write-only. Scoped this turn to nrrd + analyze (the crates that
  just gained native readers) for a complete per-crate vertical.
- [x] Extracted `write_{nrrd,analyze}_flat` substrate-agnostic core (shared
  Spacing/Point/Direction + flat slice); Burn + `_with_data` + native writers
  all wrap it. Native writer uses `data_cow_on` for layout-independent host
  extraction.
- [x] Merged reader+writer `native` modules into one crate-root `native`
  facade per crate.
- [x] ritk-io: native `NrrdWriter`/`AnalyzeWriter` implementing the unified
  `ImageWriter<Image<f32,B,3>>` contract.
- [x] Byte-identical differential oracle per crate + io writer→reader contract
  round-trips.
- [x] Gates: nrrd 35/35, analyze 5/5, io 356/356; clippy -D warnings + doc
  clean; lock churn discarded; upstream (moirai) WIP waited out.

### Verification gate (Sprint 494)
- [x] Native writer bytes == Burn writer bytes (shared core, enforced).
- [x] nrrd/analyze now have full native read+write parity (with MIG-493).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- Native-writer parity for the remaining formats: mgh, metaimage, minc, tiff,
  jpeg (png has no Burn writer). Same seam-extraction pattern; next [minor].
- Then the cli/python native cutover [major] (needs ADR) → drops Burn from
  format crates → SSOT token counts fall.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, MI/Parzen 3rd metric,
  driver early-stop; coeus gaps (multi-D FFT wrapper, gather/scatter autograd).


## Sprint 493 — MIG-493: Native-Reader Parity (nrrd + analyze)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — closing the last format-crate native gap

### In-flight plan (Sprint 493)
- [x] Two read-only audits (consumer-chain trace + coeus capability matrix)
  identified the exact cutover chokepoint (`read_image` in cli/python) and
  confirmed nrrd/analyze were the only formats lacking native readers.
- [x] ritk-nrrd: extracted `decode_nrrd` seam; Burn `read_nrrd` + `native::
  read_nrrd`/`NrrdReader` both wrap it; added `coeus-core` dep + crate-root
  `native` re-export.
- [x] ritk-analyze: same shape — `decode_analyze` seam, `native` module.
- [x] ritk-io: `format::{nrrd,analyze}::native` adapters implementing the
  unified `ImageReader<Image<f32,B,3>>` contract; 2 new differential-harness
  cases.
- [x] Differential oracle per crate (native == Burn on same file, bitwise).
- [x] Cleanup: removed 2 orphaned unused imports (mgh/metaimage native tests).
- [x] Gates: nrrd 34/34, analyze 4/4, io 354/354; clippy -D warnings + doc
  clean; lock churn discarded.

### Verification gate (Sprint 493)
- [x] All 9 format crates expose a native reader via one generic trait.
- [x] Burn path behavior unchanged (refactor-in-place; io's prior 352 pass).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- NEXT [major]: cli/python `read_image` native cutover (now unblocked) →
  begins deleting Burn from format crates → SSOT token counts drop.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, MI/Parzen 3rd metric,
  driver early-stop; coeus gaps (3D interp already native in ritk, multi-D
  FFT via apollo, gather/scatter autograd backward) for the heavy crates.


## Sprint 492 — MIG-489 Slice 4: Coeus Is Not a Feature (Un-Gate the Mainline)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — Atlas substrate promoted from opt-in to mainline

### In-flight plan (Sprint 492)
- [x] User directive: coeus fully replaces Burn — it must not be an optional
  feature. Removed the `coeus` feature from all 14 crates; coeus deps made
  unconditional; 40 source files un-gated (`cfg(all(test, feature))` →
  `cfg(test)`; `cfg(any(test, feature))` dropped).
- [x] One straggler inner attr (`#![cfg(feature = "coeus")]`) caught by the
  post-edit grep sweep and removed.
- [x] Full workspace build: zero errors. All 14 crates green in DEFAULT
  nextest runs, counts equal to the former `--features coeus` runs (2,714
  tests) — activation changed, behavior identical.
- [x] Upstream co-evolution rode along verified (hephaestus 0.10→0.11,
  mnemosyne eunomia feature in the workspace manifest + bounded lock delta).

### Verification gate (Sprint 492)
- [x] `grep 'feature = "coeus"'` returns empty workspace-wide.
- [x] The default test run now covers the entire native/autodiff surface —
  no second build configuration to maintain or forget.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- MIG-489 is now fully closed. Cutover work resumes: VTK/NRRD/Analyze/DICOM
  native readers, per-format native writers, CLI/Python consumer cutover,
  then Burn deletion (the audit token counts finally drop).
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology
  native wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.


## Sprint 491 — MIG-489 Slice 3: Zero `coeus` in ritk Function Names
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — completed the user's de-branding directive

### In-flight plan (Sprint 491)
- [x] Enumerated the complete remaining identifier map first (17 pub fns, 12
  module files, ~30 test fns across 12 crates).
- [x] Format crates: fns moved into per-file `pub mod native` blocks (brace-
  counting extraction keeps private-helper access via `use super::*`), plain
  names, lib.rs facades; ritk-io adapters + tests updated.
- [x] ritk-filter: 4 morphology wrapper files consolidated into one
  `native.rs` + one test file (net −7 files, subtractive); distance wrapper
  → `euclidean::native`; support module renamed with its harness.
- [x] interpolation/tensor-ops/statistics/registration modules + fns
  de-branded; burn/native collisions resolved by module path only.
- [x] Script artifacts caught by compiler and fixed (double-qualification,
  shadowing local imports, dangling cfg attr, merged-test collisions →
  per-op submodules).
- [x] All touched suites green (2,916 tests / 13 crates); clippy clean;
  final grep: zero `coeus` fn/struct names workspace-wide.

### Verification gate (Sprint 491)
- [x] All commands green; lock churn discarded (no dep changes).
- [x] Static dispatch preserved everywhere (generic `B: ComputeBackend`; no
  `dyn` introduced).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- MIG-489 final slice: `coeus` feature name (config-only; candidate `atlas`).
- Consumer-cutover gate unchanged (VTK/NRRD/Analyze/DICOM native readers,
  per-format native writers, CLI/Python cutover).
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology
  native wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.


## Sprint 490 — MIG-489 Slice 2: `ritk_image::coeus` → `ritk_image::native`
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — widest-fan-out de-branding slice

### In-flight plan (Sprint 490)
- [x] Enumerated fan-out first: 13 crates / 40 files reference the module
  path; chose this as its own slice (simple shape, wide reach) with the
  format-crate fn restructuring deferred to the next slice (different edit
  shape, same files — but structural vs textual edits don't conflict).
- [x] `git mv coeus.rs → native.rs`; module decl + all `ritk_image::coeus`
  paths replaced workspace-wide (30 files); `crate::coeus` intra-crate paths
  in ritk-image updated.
- [x] Full verification matrix: all 13 touched crates' coeus suites green
  (image 38, io 352, registration 740, filter 964, statistics 295,
  tensor-ops 24, nifti 37, mgh 32, metaimage 23, minc 43, png 10, jpeg 10,
  tiff 17); clippy `-D warnings` + doc clean on ritk-image.
- [x] Held gates through hermes-simd and moirai (dead-code purge)
  WIP windows; ran only on stabilized snapshots; peer trees untouched.
- [x] Lock churn discarded (pure rename, no dep changes).

### Verification gate (Sprint 490)
- [x] Zero `ritk_image::coeus` references remain workspace-wide.
- [x] Scope: rename-only; the `coeus` cargo feature names unchanged (that is
  the final MIG-489 slice).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- MIG-489 remaining: format-crate `*_coeus` fn restructuring into per-crate
  `native` modules (plain names; 7 crates + ritk-io adapters + tests), then
  the feature-name evaluation (`coeus` → `atlas`).
- Consumer-cutover gate unchanged.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology
  native wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.


## Sprint 489 — MIG-489 Slice 1: De-Brand Registration Autodiff + Inline Pass
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — naming-policy application + monomorphization pass

### In-flight plan (Sprint 489)
- [x] Verified zero users of `metric::coeus_autograd` items outside
  ritk-registration before the rename (grep).
- [x] `git mv coeus_autograd → autodiff`; de-suffixed all `*_coeus` fns;
  `CoeusTransform`/`CoeusMetric` → `autodiff::{Transform, Metric}`; removed
  the colliding metric-level flattening re-export (path-qualified access).
- [x] Rename fixed a latent bare-path shadowing hazard vs the external
  `coeus_autograd` crate.
- [x] `#[inline]` on the `transform_points` trait impls (reduce impls already
  had it); confirmed the seams stay statically dispatched (zero `dyn`).
- [x] De-branded doc prose naming our components; kept factual references to
  the external coeus-autograd engine.
- [x] Gates: full package `--features coeus` 740/740 under new names;
  default build green; clippy `-D warnings`; doc clean (0 broken links);
  lock churn discarded (no dep changes).

### Verification gate (Sprint 489)
- [x] All commands above green; zero `Coeus`-branded identifiers remain in
  ritk-registration.
- [x] Scope: ritk-registration only (17 renamed files + metric/mod.rs).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- MIG-489 remaining slices: format-crate `*_coeus` fns + `ritk_image::coeus`
  module (one coordinated change); feature-name evaluation.
- Consumer-cutover gate unchanged (VTK/NRRD/Analyze/DICOM native readers,
  per-format native writers, then CLI/Python cutover).
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology
  native wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.


## Sprint 488 — MIG-488-01 Correction: Image-Generic I/O Contract, De-Branded Types
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — user-review correction applied while unreleased

### In-flight plan (Sprint 488)
- [x] Accepted the user's review findings as correct on both counts: `Coeus*`
  names violate the no-variation-dimensions-in-names rule (worse here since
  Burn is being *completely removed*), and the contract should have been one
  generic trait, not a parallel branded pair.
- [x] Unified the contract: `ImageReader<I>`/`ImageWriter<I>`, image-generic,
  zero-cost. Verified the old trait pair had no users outside ritk-io before
  making the breaking signature change; updated all 8 Burn impl blocks and
  test turbofish call sites in the same change.
- [x] Deleted `CoeusImageReader`/`CoeusImageWriter` + `domain/coeus.rs`
  outright (no deprecation shim); renamed all 9 adapters to plain names in
  transitional `format::<fmt>::native` modules (die with Burn); removed
  root-level `Coeus*` re-exports; de-branded docs/tests; moved `to_io_err`
  to `domain`.
- [x] ADR 0002 Amendment A1 records the durable naming policy; MIG-489 filed
  for the remaining renames (format-crate `*_coeus` fns, `coeus` module
  names, feature-name candidate `atlas`).
- [x] Gates re-run green on the unified trait: `ritk-io --features coeus`
  352/352; default 344/344; clippy `-D warnings`; doc clean. Held through
  two more in-flight upstream edits (hermes bump, coeus-leto match arm).
- [x] Lock: one upstream-committed line (`mnemosyne-build-util`).

### Verification gate (Sprint 488)
- [x] All commands above green; zero `Coeus` identifiers remain in ritk-io.
- [x] Scope: ritk-io only + ADR amendment + PM artifacts.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-489 [READY]**: de-brand remaining `*_coeus` fns, module names,
  feature name (rename map recorded in the backlog item).
- Consumer-cutover gate (unchanged): VTK/NRRD/Analyze/DICOM native read
  paths + per-format native writers, then the `ritk-cli`/`ritk-python`
  cutover.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology
  native wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.


## Sprint 487 — MIG-487-01 Seven Coeus Reader Implementors (Contract Coverage 1→8)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — mechanical format coverage for the ADR-0002
cutover gate

### In-flight plan (Sprint 487)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0).
- [x] Enumerated the six remaining `read_*_coeus` signatures — all share one
  shape (`fn(path, &backend) -> Result<coeus::Image<f32, B, 3>>`), so the
  implementor pattern is uniform.
- [x] Added 7 reader implementors (jpeg, mgh, metaimage, minc, png,
  png-series, tiff), each cfg-gated in its format's own module (per-format
  placement per convention); consolidated the shared error mapping into
  `domain::coeus::to_io_err` and refactored NIfTI onto it.
- [x] Extended the `ritk-io` `coeus` feature to the six format crates.
- [x] One consolidated differential test harness: same file, two readers
  (Coeus trait vs Burn free fn), exact shape+voxel equality — lossiness-
  independent oracle; Burn-writer fixtures + synthesized PNGs.
- [x] Compiler caught a `write_metaimage` argument-order mismatch
  (path-first); fixed in the test fixture.
- [x] Gates: `ritk-io --features coeus` 352/352 (345 + 7); default 344/344;
  clippy `-D warnings` clean; doc clean; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Verification gate (Sprint 487)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope: `ritk-io` only; additive behind the feature; Burn path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **Consumer-cutover gate remainder:** Coeus read paths for VTK, NRRD,
  Analyze, DICOM (none have `read_*_coeus` yet — these need the per-crate
  boundary work first, like nifti got), and per-format Coeus writers (only
  NIfTI has one; shared-core pattern per crate).
- **Consumer cutover** (`ritk-cli`/`ritk-python`) — the real [major]; also
  carries the index↔world residual.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology Coeus
  wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.

## Sprint 486 — MIG-486-01 Coeus-Typed `ritk-io` Contract + NIfTI Implementors
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — ADR 0002 cutover step 2 (the I/O contract)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 486)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0).
- [x] Added `ritk-io` `coeus` feature (`coeus-core` + `ritk-image/coeus` +
  `ritk-nifti/coeus`).
- [x] New leaf module `domain/coeus.rs`: `CoeusImageReader`/`CoeusImageWriter`
  role traits over `ritk_image::coeus::Image<T, B, D>` — parallel family per
  ADR 0002, Burn traits untouched; deep-vertical placement mirrors the Burn
  contract's home.
- [x] First implementors `CoeusNiftiReader`/`CoeusNiftiWriter` in
  `format/nifti` (cfg-gated), wrapping the verified per-format functions —
  contract ships with live implementors on both sides (reader + writer).
- [x] Classification check: [minor], additive-only behind the feature; the
  consumer cutover remains the [major].
- [x] Trait-dispatched round-trip test (write via trait → read via trait →
  exact voxels + metadata) — the contract proven usable, not nominal.
- [x] Gates: `ritk-io --features coeus` 345/345 (344 + 1); default 344/344;
  clippy `-D warnings` clean; doc clean. Lock delta bounded (my
  `ritk-io → coeus-core` edge + upstream's committed `mnemosyne-build-util`).
- [x] Held the gate through a sibling's in-flight `coeus-leto` edit; ran only
  after upstream stabilized; peer WIP untouched.

### Verification gate (Sprint 486)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope: `ritk-io` only (Cargo.toml, domain/mod.rs + new domain/coeus.rs,
  format/nifti/mod.rs, lib.rs) + bounded lock; Burn path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- Wire the remaining 6 format readers (mgh/metaimage/minc/png/jpeg/tiff) as
  `CoeusImageReader` implementors — mechanical repeats.
- Coeus writers for remaining formats (shared-core pattern per format crate).
- **Consumer cutover** (`ritk-cli`/`ritk-python` onto the Coeus contract) —
  the real [major]; includes the index↔world residual.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology Coeus
  wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.

## Sprint 485 — MIG-485-01 First Coeus Format Writer (`write_nifti_coeus`)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — write-side cutover prerequisite; MIG-484
extraction validated in production use

### In-flight plan (Sprint 485)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0). Scoped MIG-485: no format crate had a
  Coeus *writer* (readers only), so a Coeus-typed `ImageWriter` trait would
  have had zero implementors — built the first writer (NIfTI, flagship
  format) before the trait, per the same YAGNI/implementor-count discipline
  as ADR 0001.
- [x] Refactored the NIfTI writer to a substrate-agnostic serialization SSOT
  (`write_flat_with_version`); Burn `write_nifti` and new `write_nifti_coeus`
  are thin extraction boundaries (coeus via MIG-484's `data_cow_on`).
  Consolidated the Direction→row-major mapping on its second occurrence.
- [x] Corrected the core's parameter types to the real `header_from_spatial`
  contract (`f64` spatial metadata; f32 narrowing stays inside the header
  builder where NIfTI-1 requires it).
- [x] Co-evolution fix: mnemosyne upstream removed its no-op `parallel`
  feature (committed); updated ritk's workspace manifest
  (`features = ["std_tls"]`) + bounded 4-line lock delta; `ritk-core` green.
- [x] Held the test gate through a sibling's active mnemosyne-local refactor
  (~12 min, errors changing between retries); ran only once upstream
  stabilized; peer WIP untouched.
- [x] Tests: coeus round-trip (exact voxels; spacing/origin within header
  precision) + **byte-identical differential vs the Burn writer** + Burn
  reader consuming the coeus-written file. 37/37 coeus, 34/34 default;
  clippy `-D warnings` clean; doc clean.

### Verification gate (Sprint 485)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope: `ritk-nifti` writer/lib/tests + workspace `Cargo.toml` mnemosyne
  feature + bounded `Cargo.lock`; burn behavior unchanged (byte-identical).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-486 [Phase-2, [major]]**: Coeus-typed `ritk-io` reader/writer
  contract — now justified: NIfTI has both a Coeus reader AND writer to route
  (plus 6 more format readers). Include the index↔world residual.
- Then consumers (`ritk-cli`/`ritk-python`) → leaf Burn removal → core `Image`.
- Coeus writers for the remaining formats (mgh/metaimage/minc/png/jpeg/tiff)
  — mechanical repeats of this sprint's shared-core pattern.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology Coeus
  wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.

## Sprint 484 — MIG-484-01 Coeus `Image` Host-Extraction Parity (Cutover Step 1)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — first ADR-0002 cutover-prerequisite increment

### In-flight plan (Sprint 484)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0).
- [x] Gap-audited by grep-enumerating the exact Burn-`Image` methods the
  writers/CLI/Python call: metadata accessors already have Coeus parity; the
  real gap was layout-independent host extraction (the Coeus `data_slice()`
  errors on strided views; no owned path existed).
- [x] Added `data_cow_on`/`data_cow` + `data_vec_on`/`data_vec` to
  `ritk_image::coeus::Image` — `Cow::Borrowed` when contiguous (zero-copy),
  `Cow::Owned` via `Tensor::to_contiguous_on` otherwise; mirrors the Burn
  `data_slice() -> Cow` contract. `B: Default` bound follows from
  `to_contiguous_on` itself (discovered at compile, blocks merged accordingly).
- [x] Did NOT add a closure-form `with_data_slice` twin (subsumed by
  `data_cow`; no parallel API).
- [x] Tests: contiguous → `Cow::Borrowed` + exact values; permuted
  non-contiguous view → `Cow::Owned` + logical row-major order vs a
  host-transpose oracle; `data_slice` still rejects strided views (existing
  strict contract pinned).
- [x] Gates: `ritk-image --features coeus` 38/38; downstream
  `ritk-statistics --features coeus` 295/295; clippy `-D warnings` clean;
  `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean. Discarded upstream Cargo.lock
  churn (no new deps).

### Verification gate (Sprint 484)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: one file (`crates/ritk-image/src/coeus.rs`); additive only;
  burn path untouched; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-484 residual**: index↔world transform on the Coeus `Image` (single CLI
  call site; metadata-only math) — file with MIG-485.
- **MIG-485 [Phase-2, [major]]**: Coeus-typed `ritk-io`
  `ImageReader`/`ImageWriter` surface, routing `read_*_coeus`/`write_*_coeus`.
- Then consumers (`ritk-cli`/`ritk-python`) → leaf Burn removal → core `Image`.
- Also open: PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05, MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology Coeus
  wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric, driver early-stop.

## Sprint 483 — MIG-483-01 Migration-Surface Audit + Core-Image Strategy (ADR 0002)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Foundation — audit + [arch] design artifact (no code change)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 483)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0).
- [x] Paranoia step-back after 12 registration-track sprints: ran
  `burn-migration-audit` and grepped manifests for all stated targets.
- [x] Found `rayon`/`tokio`/`nalgebra`/`ndarray`/`rustfft` already absent from
  RITK — Burn is the sole remaining substrate; token surface concentrated in
  registration/filter/interpolation/transform/model/io.
- [x] Traced the migration bottleneck: leaf crates can't drop Burn while
  `ritk_core::Image<B>` + `ritk-io::{ImageReader,ImageWriter}` are Burn-typed;
  the parallel Coeus capability adds capability but hasn't cut the Burn surface.
- [x] Wrote ADR 0002 (strategy B; top-down removal ordering; measurable
  per-crate done-criterion), rejecting unify-behind-one-trait and wholesale-swap
  with recorded reasoning.
- [x] Recorded the audit findings in `docs/coeus_migration.md`.

### Verification gate (Sprint 483)
- [x] No code change (design/audit sprint); nothing to test beyond the existing
  green baseline (Sprint 482: full package `--features coeus` 740/740).
- [x] Scope: ADR 0002 + `docs/coeus_migration.md` + PM artifacts only.

### Deferred / carry-forward — next phase is CUTOVER (per ADR 0002)
- **MIG-484 [READY, Phase-1]**: gap-audit `ritk_image::coeus::Image`'s accessor/
  host-extraction surface against each `ritk-io` consumer's needs; extend the
  Coeus `Image` (and Coeus) to fill gaps, tested — the prerequisite before any
  cutover.
- **MIG-485 [Phase-2, [major]]**: Coeus-typed `ritk-io` `ImageReader`/
  `ImageWriter` surface + route `read_*_coeus`/`write_*_coeus` through it.
- Then consumers (`ritk-cli`/`ritk-python`) → leaf crates' Burn removal → core
  `Image` last.
- Also open (non-migration): PERF-432-01, TEST-447-05 (MINC hostile fixture),
  MIG-439-03, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers, MI/Parzen 3rd metric,
  driver tolerance-based early stop.

## Sprint 482 — MIG-482-01 Coeus-Native Gradient-Descent Registration Driver
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — the parallel Coeus primitives composed into a
runnable end-to-end unit

### In-flight plan (Sprint 482)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0); confirmed upstream (leto) builds green
  (heavy build contention).
- [x] Diagnosed the standing gap (paranoia check): 10 sprints of verified Coeus
  registration primitives had **no composed runnable entry point** — chose the
  driver over a 3rd metric (MI) as higher-value/lower-risk (MI is fiddly
  shape-gymnastics; build cycles are expensive under contention; the driver
  reuses only already-verified ops).
- [x] Added `driver::gradient_descent` + `GradientDescentConfig` +
  `RegistrationOutcome` — generic over `CoeusMetric`/`CoeusTransform`, transform
  rebuilt each iteration from parameter leaves via a caller closure (no
  parameter-reflection trait needed).
- [x] Fixed a `final_loss` off-by-one by re-evaluating at the returned
  post-step params.
- [x] Tests: recovers a known translation (loss → <1e-8); generic over `Affine`
  (multi-param, substantial reduction). Corrected an arbitrary over-strong
  1000× convergence threshold to a defensible order-of-magnitude bar (the test
  verifies genericity + reduction, not a specific rate — no analytical
  requirement for 1000×).
- [x] 42/42 `coeus_autograd`; full package `--features coeus` 740/740; default
  build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` and `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean. Discarded upstream-migration Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 482)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: new `driver.rs` + `tests_driver.rs` + two `mod.rs`
  re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta; burn path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- Wiring `gradient_descent` behind the production registration API (still Burn):
  needs multi-resolution, convergence/stopping policy, and caller migration —
  the larger remaining phase.
- Coeus-native MI/Parzen metric (3rd `CoeusMetric` implementor).
- A tolerance-based early-stop for the driver (currently fixed iteration count).
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 481 — MIG-478-02 Coeus-Native `CoeusMetric` Reduction Seam (Mse/Ncc)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — second registration seam introduced, composition
generalized

### In-flight plan (Sprint 481)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0); confirmed upstream (leto) builds green.
- [x] Added `traits::CoeusMetric` (`reduce(sampled, fixed) -> loss`, `T: Float`)
  — minimal role interface; transform+sample stays shared (interface
  segregation).
- [x] Added `Mse`/`Ncc` ZST implementors in `mse.rs`/`ncc.rs` (SoC: each metric
  owns its struct+impl next to its reduction fn).
- [x] Generalized composition SSOT to `metric::evaluate<M, Tf>`; `mse_metric`
  now `evaluate(…, &Mse, …)`; `affine_mse_coeus` still delegates. Tightened
  those two to `T: Float` (Float covers all image types; no real caller lost).
- [x] Tests: `evaluate`+Mse == `mse_metric`; `evaluate`+Ncc == manual
  sample-then-NCC (and ≠ MSE, proving the seam switches reductions);
  NCC-through-Affine gradient reaches R and is shift-invariant in t.
- [x] Corrected an over-strong initial NCC-gradient assertion — the failure
  surfaced a real property (NCC additive-shift-invariance ⇒ ∂loss/∂t=0 for a
  translated linear field), now encoded as the expected behavior rather than
  weakened.
- [x] 40/40 `coeus_autograd`; full package `--features coeus` 738/738; default
  build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` and `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean. Discarded upstream-migration Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 481)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: `traits.rs`, `mse.rs`, `ncc.rs`, `metric.rs`, `tests_traits.rs`,
  two `mod.rs` re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta; burn path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- Coeus-native MI/Parzen metric — a third `CoeusMetric` implementor; the seam is
  designed to accept it (reduction over the two intensity vectors).
- Wiring the Coeus registration path into the production (Burn) engine —
  needs an engine-loop/multi-resolution port + caller migration.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 480 — MIG-480-01 Coeus-Native Differentiable NCC Loss Reduction
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — second Coeus metric reduction added (unblocks the
`CoeusMetric` trait)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 480)
- [x] Confirmed `sqrt`/`neg`/`div` autograd op bounds (`T: Float`) by source
  before authoring; NCC function bounded `T: Float`.
- [x] Implemented `ncc::normalized_cross_correlation_coeus` — single-pass
  algebraic-moments `−NCC`, entirely on the autograd tape.
- [x] Verified analytically: perfect correlation → `−1`, anti-correlation →
  `+1`, host-reference forward match, finite-difference gradient check.
- [x] **Concurrent-agent block, handled per protocol:** mid-sprint the Atlas
  dependency graph was broken by sibling agents migrating the `leto` foundation
  crate (uncommitted, non-compiling → cascade through coeus/gaia/apollo/ritk).
  Investigated and pinpointed the root cause (leto `array.rs`/`geometry.rs`
  uncommitted WIP); did **not** touch the peer's tree; held verification and
  reported the block rather than committing unverified code.
- [x] On upstream recovery, ran the full gate green: `cargo nextest run
  -p ritk-registration --features coeus coeus_autograd::ncc` 5/5; full package
  `--features coeus` 735/735; default build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings`
  and `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Restored `Cargo.lock` (no new dep edges; discarded upstream-migration
  churn).

### Verification gate (Sprint 480)
- [x] All commands above green (after upstream recovery).
- [x] Scope check: only `ncc.rs` + `tests_ncc.rs` + two `mod.rs` re-exports;
  no Cargo.lock delta; burn path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-478-02 [READY, unblocked]**: `CoeusMetric` reduction seam over `Mse` +
  `Ncc`, generalizing `mse_metric` to `evaluate<M, Tf>`.
- Coeus-native MI/Parzen metric (a third `CoeusMetric` implementor); wiring the
  Coeus registration path into the production (Burn) engine.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 479 — MIG-479-01 Consolidate Per-Axis Translation onto the Trait Seam
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — DRY/SSOT consolidation, superseded code removed

### In-flight plan (Sprint 479)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Confirmed via grep that `translation_mse_coeus` and `translate_axis_coeus`
  had only test callers after ADR 0001 (superseded by `Translation` +
  `mse_metric`).
- [x] Removed both functions and their re-exports; left one authoritative
  translation path (`Translation` `CoeusTransform` → `mse_metric`). `mse_metric`
  is now the sole split→sample→mse composition (SSOT).
- [x] Migrated their analytical coverage onto the SSOT path rather than dropping
  it: translation identity/closed-form-gradient/FD/GD-convergence tests now use
  `mse_metric` + `Translation`; added a `Translation` param-gradient-sums-to-N
  test to preserve the broadcast-summing-backward assertion.
- [x] Verified: 32/32 `coeus_autograd`; full package `--features coeus`
  730/730; default build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc
  --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 479)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only the `coeus_autograd/` tree (metric/transform/mod +
  three test files) and `metric/mod.rs` re-export; no Cargo.lock delta; burn
  path untouched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-478-02 [BLOCKED]**: `CoeusMetric` trait — introduce with the 2nd metric
  type (NCC/MI), per ADR 0001.
- Coeus-native NCC / MI metrics — the natural next Coeus-registration direction
  (a Coeus NCC unblocks `CoeusMetric`).
- Wiring the Coeus registration path into the production engine (still Burn):
  needs `CoeusMetric` + engine-loop/multi-resolution port + caller migration —
  each a further tracked increment.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 478 — MIG-478-01 Coeus-Native `CoeusTransform` Trait Surface + Generic Metric
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — [arch] seam introduced (ADR-first)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 478)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Wrote ADR 0001 (`docs/adr/0001-coeus-native-registration-traits.md`):
  parallel Coeus trait family (not substrate-generalization of the burn-bound
  `ritk_core` traits), `[N,3]` canonical coordinate convention, one generic MSE
  metric over `CoeusTransform` implementors. Recorded the deferrals
  (`CoeusMetric` until a 2nd metric; `translation_mse_coeus` consolidation).
- [x] Implemented `traits::CoeusTransform` (mirrors burn
  `Transform::transform_points`), `transform::{Translation, Affine}`
  implementors, and `metric::mse_metric<Tf>` (composition SSOT).
- [x] Refactored `affine_mse_coeus` to delegate to `mse_metric` — removed its
  duplicated split→sample→mse composition (net-effect: consolidation).
- [x] Dropped the `Debug` derive on the transform structs (`Var` is not
  `Debug`); kept `Clone`.
- [x] Verified differentially: `mse_metric`+`Affine` == `affine_mse_coeus`;
  `Affine`/`Translation` structs match free-function/closed-form refs; GD
  through `Translation` drives loss to ~0. 34/34 `coeus_autograd`; full package
  `--features coeus` 732/732; default build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings`
  and `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 478)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: new `traits.rs` + `tests_traits.rs`, transform-struct
  additions, `mse_metric` + `affine_mse_coeus` delegation, `mod.rs` re-exports,
  ADR; no Cargo.lock delta; no change to the burn path or `ritk_core` traits.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-479-01 [READY]**: consolidate `translation_mse_coeus` onto
  `mse_metric` + `Translation` (last duplicated composition).
- **MIG-478-02 [BLOCKED]**: `CoeusMetric` trait — introduce with the 2nd
  metric type (NCC/MI), per ADR 0001.
- Coeus-native NCC / MI metrics (would justify `CoeusMetric` and extend the
  metric coverage beyond MSE) — natural next Coeus-registration direction.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 477 — MIG-477-01 End-to-End Coeus-Autograd Affine-MSE Registration Metric
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — affine composition completed; primitive set for
the Coeus registration path is now complete

### In-flight plan (Sprint 477)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Composed `affine_mse_coeus` = mse ∘ trilinear ∘ (slice/reshape of
  affine[N,3]) ∘ affine, using the confirmed-differentiable `slice`+`reshape`
  to split the affine output into the per-axis coords the sampler needs.
- [x] Verified end-to-end analytically: linear moving field → trilinear exact →
  closed-form host reference matched at forward; identity → zero loss + zero
  R/t gradient; all 9 R + 3 t gradients vs self-consistent finite differences
  (full matmul→slice→reshape→trilinear→mse tape); 200-step GD loop drives
  loss monotonically to <1e-8.
- [x] Documented honestly: single-ramp field constrains only `slope·t`, so
  loss→0 (alignment) is the claim, not unique parameter recovery.
- [x] 8/8 metric tests; full package `--features coeus` 728/728; default build
  unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 477)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only `metric.rs` + `tests_metric.rs` + the two `mod.rs`
  re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-478-01 [arch, READY — ADR first]**: the Coeus-native
  `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface. The primitive set is now complete and
  verified; the parameter shapes are known. Per [major]/[arch] discipline the
  ADR must be written and signed off before the trait implementation begins.
  This is the culmination the last seven increments (MIG-471 … 477) were
  de-risking.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 476 — MIG-476-01 Coeus-Autograd Differentiable Affine Transform
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — matmul-based affine transform primitive added

### In-flight plan (Sprint 476)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Resolved the deferred design decision by reading source: both
  `coeus-autograd` `slice` (range) and `index_select` are differentiable
  (scatter/scatter-add backward), so the `[N,3]`+`matmul` formulation is
  viable. Chose it over the per-axis-scalar form — natural `[3,3]`/`[3]`
  parameter tensors + exercises Coeus `matmul` per the migration directive.
- [x] Implemented `transform::affine_transform_coeus` = `coords·Rᵀ + t`
  (`matmul` + `transpose_2d` + `reshape` + `broadcast_to` + `add`), returning
  `[N,3]`; gradient to `R` and `t`.
- [x] Verified analytically: forward vs host reference under rotation+shear+
  scale `R` (all 9 entries participate); translation gradient = N; matrix
  gradient `∂(Σout)/∂R[j,k] = Σ_n coords[n,k]` closed form + 9-entry
  finite-difference cross-check. 6/6 (`coeus_autograd::transform`).
- [x] Full package `--features coeus` 724/724; default build unaffected;
  clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn.

### Verification gate (Sprint 476)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only `transform.rs` + `tests_transform.rs` + the two
  `mod.rs` re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-477-01 [READY]**: compose `affine_transform_coeus` + trilinear sample
  + MSE into an end-to-end affine-MSE metric (splitting the `[N,3]` output to
  the per-axis sampler via the confirmed-differentiable `slice`), with a
  gradient-descent recovery of a known rotation+translation. Last empirical
  piece before the Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait ADR.
- The trait-surface ADR is now well-supported (translation + affine
  primitives, composed metric, convergence proof) and near-ready to open.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 475 — MIG-475-01 Coeus-Autograd Gradient-Descent Optimizability Proof
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — optimizer step + end-to-end convergence proof

### In-flight plan (Sprint 475)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Checked Coeus for an existing `Var`-level optimizer step: only a
  low-level fused `sgd_step` over raw device buffers exists (coeus-ops), no
  `Var`-level helper — so a thin ritk-side step is warranted (not reinventing).
- [x] Added `optim::sgd_step_var` — returns a fresh `requires_grad` leaf
  `param − lr·grad` (tape-based-autograd idiom; off-tape param update).
- [x] Split the affine-transform half of the former MIG-475-01 into MIG-476-01
  — its per-axis-vs-`matmul`/column-split API decision deserves a focused
  increment rather than being rushed alongside the optimizability proof.
- [x] Verified: 20-step GD loop on `translation_mse_coeus` from a +1 offset →
  loss strictly decreases each step, `tx` converges to `1.0` within `1e-6`
  (closed-form quadratic bowl); plus 2 `sgd_step_var` unit tests. 23/23
  (`coeus_autograd` filter, 3 new + 20 prior).
- [x] Full package `--features coeus` 721/721; default build unaffected;
  clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn
  (no deps added); commit lock-clean.

### Verification gate (Sprint 475)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only the `coeus_autograd/` tree (new `optim.rs` +
  `tests_optim.rs`, GD test appended to `tests_metric.rs`) and the two
  `mod.rs` re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-476-01 [READY]**: differentiable affine transform (`R·coords + t`);
  resolve per-axis-vs-`matmul`+column-split first. Precedes the trait ADR.
- Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface still [arch] (ADR-gated) —
  now backed by both a composed metric *and* proof it optimizes.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 474 — MIG-474-01 End-to-End Coeus-Autograd MSE-over-a-Translation Metric
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — differentiable primitives composed into a usable
metric

### In-flight plan (Sprint 474)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Verified `broadcast_to` semantics (rank-preserving, summing backward)
  before using it for the scalar translation parameter — its backward
  sum-reduces the broadcast dim, giving the correct single-parameter gradient.
- [x] Added `transform::translate_axis_coeus` (`coords + broadcast(t)`) — the
  differentiable transform primitive; no new Coeus op needed.
- [x] Composed `metric::translation_mse_coeus` = mse ∘ sample_trilinear ∘
  translate, gradient to the three per-axis translation params. New SRP
  modules `transform.rs` and `metric.rs` under `coeus_autograd/`.
- [x] Verified end-to-end analytically: ramp moving + 1-voxel-shifted fixed →
  closed-form loss `(tx−1)²`, `∂loss/∂tx = −2` at `tx=0` (exact); identity
  alignment → zero loss + zero gradient; degenerate y/z axes → exactly zero
  gradient; self-consistent central finite-difference cross-check on the
  metric's own forward; 3 translation-primitive gradient tests.
- [x] 20/20 (`coeus_autograd` filter, 6 new + 14 prior); full package
  `--features coeus` 718/718; default build unaffected; clippy `-D warnings`
  clean; `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean (fixed one `[arch]`
  broken-intra-doc-link).
- [x] Discarded the recurring unrelated `ndarray`-drop Cargo.lock churn (no
  deps added this sprint); commit is lock-clean.

### Verification gate (Sprint 474)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only the `coeus_autograd/` tree (2 new modules + 2 new test
  files) and the two `mod.rs` re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-475-01 [READY]**: differentiable affine/rigid transform (matmul-based)
  + a gradient-descent alignment demonstration (loss monotonically decreases,
  parameter converges to the true offset) — the empirical evidence before
  opening the ADR for the Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface.
- Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface still [arch] (ADR-gated);
  now has a concrete composed metric to model its shape on.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 473 — MIG-473-01 Coeus-Autograd Differentiable Trilinear Sampling
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — 3-D sampling primitive added, per-axis helper
consolidated

### In-flight plan (Sprint 473)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Extended the 1-D mechanism (proven in MIG-472-01) to 3-D trilinear in
  `sample_trilinear_coeus`: 8-corner `gather` from a flattened moving-image
  `Var`, flat index `z·Y·X + y·X + x` with per-axis independent corner clamps,
  corner weight = product of the three per-axis fractional-weight `Var`s.
- [x] Coordinates passed per axis (three `[N]` `Var`s) — avoids a
  differentiable column-slice dependency and gives three independent
  coordinate leaves; documented the rationale.
- [x] DRY: factored the per-axis floor/clamp/weight logic into
  `AxisInterp`/`axis_interp` and refactored the 1-D sampler onto it (no
  duplicated per-axis logic across the two samplers).
- [x] Verified analytically: separable-ramp per-axis gradients = closed-form
  slopes (`∂/∂z=bz`, etc.); host trilinear-reference forward match;
  per-axis central finite-difference cross-check; integer-voxel `gather`
  value-gradient. 14/14 (`coeus_autograd` filter).
- [x] Full package `--features coeus` 712/712 (708 + 4 new); default build
  unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean (fixed an `identity_op` in a test
  flat-index expr); `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean (fixed one
  private-intra-doc-link on `AxisInterp`).
- [x] Discarded an unrelated concurrent-agent `ndarray`-drop churn in
  Cargo.lock (I added no deps) to keep the commit lock-clean.

### Verification gate (Sprint 473)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only the `metric/coeus_autograd/sampling.rs` +
  `tests_sampling.rs` + the two `mod.rs` re-exports; no Cargo.lock delta.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-474-01 [READY]**: compose the three verified primitives (trilinear
  sample + differentiable translation + MSE) into an end-to-end
  MSE-over-a-transform metric with gradient to the transform parameters. Needs
  a trivial differentiable translation primitive first (no new Coeus op).
- Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface remains [arch] (ADR-gated);
  the composition (MIG-474-01) will inform its shape.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — still open.

## Sprint 472 — MIG-472-01 Coeus-Autograd Differentiable 1-D Linear Sampling
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — differentiable-sampling mechanism proven and
verified

### In-flight plan (Sprint 472)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Resolved the MIG-472-01 blocker first: read
  `coeus-autograd/src/ops/shape/select/gather.rs`. `gather(input, dim, index)`
  — index is a `Var<T,B>` of integer-valued floats; backward is `scatter_add`
  into `input` (differentiable through gathered values), index non-
  differentiable. Confirms the interpolation pattern: coordinate gradient must
  flow through the fractional weights (`Var` ops on coords), not the indices.
- [x] Confirmed the arithmetic seam (`sub`/`add`/`mul`/`gather` signatures and
  bounds; gather needs `B::DeviceBuffer<T>: CpuAddressableStorage +
  CpuAddressableStorageMut`).
- [x] Partitioned `metric/coeus_autograd.rs` into a directory (`mod.rs`,
  `mse.rs`, `sampling.rs`, `tests_mse.rs`, `tests_sampling.rs`) per the
  two-bounded-concerns growth trigger (loss reduction vs. sampling = distinct
  SRP units). MSE moved unchanged (its doc trimmed; umbrella doc → mod.rs).
- [x] Implemented `sample_linear_1d_coeus`: floor/clamped-corner indices built
  as constant `Var`s from a host read of coords (does not detach coords from
  the tape); fractional weight `f = sub(coords, floor_const)` keeps coords on
  the tape (∂f/∂coords = 1); `out = v0·(1−f) + v1·f` with `v0,v1` from
  differentiable `gather`.
- [x] Verified analytically: ramp coordinate gradient = closed-form slope;
  `gather` value-gradient reaches `signal`; edge-clamp → flat extrapolation
  with zero coordinate gradient; forward matches the linear-interp reference;
  central finite-difference cross-check. 10/10 (`coeus_autograd` filter).
- [x] Full package `--features coeus` 708/708 (703 + 5 new); default build
  unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean after fixing one `[arch]` broken-intra-doc-link.
- [x] Cargo.lock unchanged (no new dep edges); updated `docs/coeus_migration.md`
  Verified Increments.

### Verification gate (Sprint 472)
- [x] All commands above green.
- [x] Scope check: only the `metric/coeus_autograd/` directory (restructure +
  new sampling module + tests), `metric/mod.rs` re-export, migration doc, and
  PM artifacts.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-473-01 [READY]**: extend to 3-D trilinear sampling (8-corner gather),
  the last primitive before an end-to-end Coeus MSE-over-a-transform metric.
  Mechanism already de-risked here; it's the index-arithmetic extension.
- Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface remains [arch] (needs ADR);
  still delivering free-function primitives until the trait shape is informed
  by the trilinear + transform primitives.
- `PERF-432-01`, `MIG-439-03`, grayscale-morphology Coeus wrappers,
  MIG-456-04, `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` — all still open.

## Sprint 471 — MIG-471-01 Coeus-Autograd Differentiable MSE Loss Kernel
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — first verified increment of the registration
autodiff migration path

### In-flight plan (Sprint 471)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Acted on the user's clarification that Coeus is predominately the
  autograd/ML layer (built on leto/hephaestus/apollo internally) — pivoted
  from leaf filter wrappers to the differentiable registration-metric path,
  the intended high-value target. Confirmed `coeus-autograd` is a full
  reverse-mode engine (128 differentiable ops incl. gather/matmul/conv) via
  a scoped subagent API survey.
- [x] Read the ritk seam: `Metric`/`Transform` traits are hard-bound to
  `burn::tensor` — full trait migration is [arch]-class. Chose the disciplined
  Phase-1: one verified, non-mock building block + SSOT doc update, not an
  ad-hoc rewrite.
- [x] Added `coeus-autograd` (+ `coeus-ops`, needed for the `BackendOps`
  bound) to the workspace and the crate's `coeus` feature.
- [x] Implemented `metric::coeus_autograd::mean_squared_error_coeus`
  (`mean((moving − fixed)²)`, generic over `T: Scalar`, `B: ComputeBackend +
  BackendOps<T> + Default`), entirely in the autograd graph — no host
  extraction (gate #3).
- [x] Verified analytically (strongest oracle): closed-form value; closed-form
  gradients w.r.t. moving (`+2/N·(m−f)`) and fixed (`−2/N·(m−f)`); central
  finite-difference cross-check; perfect-match zero case. 5/5 via
  `cargo nextest run -p ritk-registration --features coeus coeus_autograd`.
- [x] Full package `--features coeus` 703/703 (incl. the 86s PERF-432-01
  bspline test under its 600s override); default build unaffected
  (`#[cfg(feature = "coeus")]`); clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc
  --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Cargo.lock: 15 lines, only the genuine new edges (re-added
  `coeus-autograd` package entry + ritk-registration → coeus-autograd/
  coeus-ops); no unrelated churn.
- [x] Updated `docs/coeus_migration.md` (SSOT) with a "Verified Increments"
  section recording this step against the dev sequence.

### Verification gate (Sprint 471)
- [x] All commands above run and green.
- [x] Scope check: only Cargo.toml (workspace + crate), metric/mod.rs, two
  new files, docs/coeus_migration.md, and PM artifacts; no unrelated source
  touched.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- **MIG-472-01 [READY]**: differentiable image sampling (interpolation of a
  moving `Var` at transform-dependent coords) — the step that makes the MSE
  kernel a function of transform parameters. Blocker: confirm Coeus `gather`
  index semantics first. Filed with acceptance + analytical oracle.
- Full Coeus-native `Metric`/`Transform` trait surface remains [arch] (needs
  ADR); this sprint deliberately delivered a free-function primitive, not the
  trait redesign.
- `PERF-432-01` still open (Sprint 464 finding).
- `MIG-439-03` workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit not yet performed.
- Grayscale morphology / label / reconstruction Coeus wrappers (Sprint 470
  carry-forward) still open — lower priority than the autodiff path now.
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 470 — MIG-470-01 Complete Coeus Binary-Morphology Family + Test-Harness Consolidation
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — three new verified code paths, one consolidation

### In-flight plan (Sprint 470)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Verified each target core's Burn-independence by source read before
  wrapping (per established discipline): `dilate_binary_3d` is pure
  separable-sweep `&[f32]`→`Vec<f32>`; `BinaryMorphologicalClosing`/
  `Opening` compose `erode_binary_3d`/`dilate_binary_3d` directly on flat
  buffers with no separate core. All substrate-agnostic — boundary-wrapper
  tasks, same shape as erode (Sprint 468).
- [x] Added `binary_dilate_coeus`, `binary_closing_coeus`,
  `binary_opening_coeus` through the shared `map_flat_image` helper. Each
  reproduces its Burn counterpart's exact core composition; no algorithm
  rewritten.
- [x] Consolidated the differential-test harness on its second occurrence:
  factored `coeus_support::assert_coeus_matches_burn` and rewrote the
  pre-existing `tests_binary_erode_coeus.rs` and
  `tests_unsigned_coeus.rs` (distance transform) to use it, then wrote the
  three new test files against it — five wrapper test files, one harness,
  no copied scaffolding.
- [x] Verified: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter --features coeus`
  964/964 (944 + 20 Coeus differential); default-feature 944/944
  unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean; Cargo.lock unchanged (no new dep edges).

### Verification gate (Sprint 470)
- [x] All commands above run and green.
- [x] Scope check: only `ritk-filter` touched (morphology/mod.rs, 3 new
  wrapper files + 3 new test files, coeus_support.rs harness addition, and
  2 pre-existing test files refactored onto the harness).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open (Sprint 464 finding).
- `MIG-439-03`'s workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit not yet performed.
- Binary-morphology family Coeus layer is now complete (erode/dilate/
  closing/opening). Remaining `ritk-filter` morphology with no Coeus
  coverage: grayscale morphology (erosion/dilation/closing/opening/
  gradient/geodesic/fillhole/grind-peak), label morphology, hit-or-miss,
  top-hat, h-transform, regional-extrema, reconstruction, thinning/pruning
  — check each core's Burn-independence before wrapping (grayscale ops
  likely have pure cores too; label/reconstruction ops may not). Also
  chamfer-distance and convolution kernels. None yet individually verified.
- Registration metric-kernel Coeus migration still gated on Coeus-native
  `Transform`/`Interpolator` paths (NOT on autodiff, which exists — see
  Sprint 469 correction).
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 469 — MIG-469-01 Retract False "Coeus Has No Autodiff" Claim
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Foundation — correcting a false claim from Sprint 468, no
code change

### In-flight plan (Sprint 469)
- [x] User directly challenged the Sprint 468 claim "Coeus does not
  provide autodiff." Did not defend it — checked immediately.
- [x] Read `D:/atlas/repos/coeus/coeus-autograd/Cargo.toml`,
  `src/lib.rs`, and `src/var.rs`: confirmed a real, existing reverse-mode
  autodiff crate with `Var<T, B>::backward`/`backward_with_seed`, a full
  computation graph (`BackwardNode`), and 100+ differentiable ops
  (`gather`, `index_select`, `matmul`, `conv1d/2d/3d`, `softmax`, loss
  functions, reductions, etc.) — comparable in scope to Burn's
  `AutodiffBackend`. The Sprint 468 claim was false, asserted without
  verification.
- [x] Corrected backlog.md's MIG-468-01 entry in place with the verified
  facts, and filed this correction as its own tracked item (MIG-469-01),
  matching the Sprint 464/465 retraction precedent (correct in place with
  evidence, don't silently edit history).
- [x] Preserved the part of the original reasoning that remains valid and
  independent of the autodiff question: `Transform`/`Interpolator`/`Image`
  still lack Coeus-native paths, and no `ritk-*` crate currently depends on
  `coeus-autograd` — the metric-kernel port is still gated on that, just
  not on "Coeus can't do autodiff in principle" (which is false).

### Verification gate (Sprint 469)
- [x] No source code changed — `git status`/`git diff` clean on every file
  under `crates/`. Only PM artifacts touched.
- [x] Evidence tier: direct source read of the sibling `coeus-autograd`
  crate, not a subagent report or reasoning from silence.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open (Sprint 464 finding).
- `MIG-439-03`'s workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit not yet performed.
- Registration metric-kernel Coeus migration: now understood as gated on
  (a) `Transform`/`Interpolator`/`Image` needing Coeus-native paths and
  (b) no `ritk-*` crate yet depending on `coeus-autograd` — NOT gated on
  Coeus lacking autodiff. This reopens the door to eventually porting MI's
  differentiable Parzen histogramming once (a) and (b) are addressed, but
  that is still a multi-crate foundational effort, not a scoped increment
  for a single sprint. Do not re-attempt until `Transform`/`Interpolator`
  have Coeus-native equivalents.
- `binary_dilate` remains the next likely `ritk-filter` Coeus candidate
  (erosion's dual), not yet independently verified.
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 468 — MIG-468-01 Coeus-Native Binary Erosion + Shared Boundary Helper
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — new verified code path added, one consolidation

### In-flight plan (Sprint 468)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main (0/0) before starting.
- [x] Verified the flagged `ritk-registration` metric-kernel target
  properly before touching code: read `mse.rs`, `ncc.rs`, and the classical
  (non-Burn) `spatial/transform.rs`. Found metrics are tensor-op-native
  throughout (not a thin wrapper around a substrate-agnostic core, unlike
  distance-transform/trilinear), and MI's Parzen histogramming is
  differentiable-by-design for gradient optimization — Coeus has no
  autodiff. Also confirmed the classical engine already uses
  `leto::Array3`, never depended on Burn. **Explicitly rejected as this
  sprint's target** — recorded precisely in backlog.md so it isn't
  re-attempted without first building Coeus-native `Transform`/
  `Interpolator` paths.
- [x] Found the next real, safely-scoped target instead: `ritk-morphology`
  (the pure-algorithm crate) has zero Burn dependency at all already;
  `ritk-filter/src/morphology/binary_erode.rs`'s `erode_binary_3d` core is
  the same "already substrate-agnostic, needs a boundary wrapper only"
  shape as distance-transform.
- [x] Noticed the boundary-wrapper marshaling (extract shape+data → pure fn
  → `Image::from_flat_on`) was about to be written a second time verbatim
  (`unsigned_coeus.rs` already had it). Per the second-occurrence
  consolidation rule, factored it into `crates/ritk-filter/src/
  coeus_support.rs::map_flat_image` first, then refactored
  `unsigned_coeus.rs` to use it, then wrote `binary_erode_coeus.rs` against
  the shared helper — no third copy of the marshaling sequence.
  `map_flat_image` is `pub(crate)`; two rustdoc private-intra-doc-link
  warnings from referencing it (and the also-`pub(crate)` `erode_binary_3d`)
  in public doc comments were fixed by removing the link brackets, not by
  suppressing the lint.
- [x] Added 4 differential tests for `binary_erode_coeus` vs. the Burn path
  (radius-zero identity, all-foreground, scattered foreground, all-
  background) — all passed first try (expected: same core routine on both
  sides, so no algorithmic divergence is possible, only a boundary bug
  would show up).
- [x] Verified: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter --features coeus`
  952/952 (944 + 8 across both Coeus wrappers); default-feature 944/944
  unaffected; clippy `-D warnings` clean; `cargo doc --features coeus
  --no-deps` clean after the de-linking fix.
- [x] Cargo.lock: no change needed (no new external dependency edges).

### Verification gate (Sprint 468)
- [x] All commands above run and green.
- [x] Scope check: only `ritk-filter` touched (lib.rs, morphology/mod.rs,
  distance/euclidean/unsigned_coeus.rs refactor, 3 new files).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open (Sprint 464: 84.1% of `transform_3d_chunk` in
  the coefficients gather+weighted-sum block).
- `MIG-439-03`'s real scope (workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit) not
  yet performed.
- `ritk-filter` still has ~15 other morphology filters
  (dilate/opening/closing/fillhole/grayscale-*/label-*/hit-or-miss/etc.)
  plus convolution/chamfer-distance kernels with no Coeus coverage — most
  are plausibly the same boundary-wrapper shape as `binary_erode` (check
  each core for a Burn dependency before wrapping, per this sprint's and
  Sprint 467's demonstrated discipline), but none yet individually
  verified. `binary_dilate` is the natural next candidate (erosion's dual,
  likely identical structure).
- `ritk-registration`'s metric kernels are now a **confirmed non-target**
  until Coeus-native `Transform`/`Interpolator` paths exist — do not
  re-survey this without that prerequisite.
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 467 — MIG-467-01 Coeus-Native Euclidean Distance Transform
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — new verified Coeus-native code path added

### In-flight plan (Sprint 467)
- [x] Re-synced with origin/main first (0 commits behind/ahead) — no
  concurrent-agent changes to reconcile before starting.
- [x] Picked the next flagged-but-unverified target from Sprint 466:
  `ritk-filter` has zero `coeus` feature. Verified before committing to a
  plan (per the same discipline that caught two stale survey findings last
  sprint): the crate's `euclidean_dt` core is already
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and substrate-agnostic (no Burn dependency,
  pure `&[bool]` in, `Vec<f32>` out) — so this is a boundary-wrapper task,
  not an algorithm port, matching the FFT precedent (Sprint 466) rather
  than the trilinear precedent (a genuine port).
- [x] Added the `coeus` feature to `ritk-filter/Cargo.toml` and a new
  `distance/euclidean/unsigned_coeus.rs` wrapping `euclidean_dt` for
  `ritk_image::coeus::Image<f32, B, 3>`, bound on `B::DeviceBuffer<f32>:
  CpuAddressableStorage<f32>` (needed for `data_slice()` readback, which
  the FFT/trilinear precedents didn't need).
- [x] Removed a `distance_transform_coeus_default` convenience wrapper after
  clippy flagged it as dead code — callers can pass
  `BinarizationThreshold::DEFAULT` directly; not adding an unused
  convenience function (YAGNI).
- [x] Added 4 differential tests vs. the Burn/NdArray reference; all passed
  first try (no divergence found, unlike the trilinear port which had a
  real bug) — expected, since both paths call the identical core routine.
- [x] Hit a transient build break in `leto` (concurrent agent's uncommitted
  WIP, confirmed via `git status` in that repo). Did not touch it or work
  around it; retried the same command a few minutes later and it had
  resolved itself.
- [x] Verified: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter --features coeus` 948/948
  (944 + 4 new); default-feature 944/944 unaffected; clippy `-D warnings`
  clean; `cargo doc --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Cargo.lock: clean single-edge diff this time (no unrelated churn to
  reconcile — the earlier coeus 0.5.4->0.5.5 bump had already landed on
  `main` via Sprint 466's merge).

### Verification gate (Sprint 467)
- [x] All commands above run and green.
- [x] Scope check: only `ritk-filter` touched (Cargo.toml, euclidean/mod.rs,
  two new files) plus `Cargo.lock`.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open (Sprint 464: 84.1% of `transform_3d_chunk` in
  the coefficients gather+weighted-sum block).
- `MIG-439-03`'s real scope (workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit) not yet
  performed.
- `ritk-filter` still has no coeus coverage for its morphology/convolution/
  chamfer-distance kernels — only the Euclidean-distance boundary is done
  now. `ritk-registration`'s metric compute kernels (histogram/MI/NCC/
  gradient) remain Burn-only despite the crate's `coeus` feature. Neither
  yet independently verified for the next scoped increment.
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 466 — MIG-466-01 Coeus-Native Trilinear Interpolation
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Execution — new verified Coeus-native code path added

### In-flight plan (Sprint 466)
- [x] Surveyed coeus/leto/hephaestus integration gaps via subagent, then
  independently verified the top two findings before acting on them
  (codebase_fidelity: re-verify before acting) — both were stale/overstated:
  Kabsch already uses `leto_ops::svd_rank_revealing` (not Burn), and
  `ritk-filter`'s FFT math already runs through `apollo-fft` (extract/rebuild
  is only the Burn-`Image` boundary, unavoidable while `Image<B,D>` stays
  Burn-generic). Confirmed zero remaining `rustfft`/`nalgebra` edges
  workspace-wide.
- [x] Picked the next real gap: `ritk-interpolation` had no `coeus` feature
  at all. Added one, following the `ritk-jpeg`/`ritk-statistics` template.
- [x] Implemented `trilinear_interpolation_coeus` (flat-buffer,
  `coeus_core::Scalar`-generic) mirroring `tensor_trilinear::
  trilinear_interpolation`'s exact op sequence. First draft had a real bug —
  derived the upper-neighbor clamp index from the already-clamped lower
  index instead of independently clamping `floor+1`, which diverges from
  Burn's independent-clamp pair at negative coordinates. Caught by the
  negative-coordinate differential test before landing; fixed.
- [x] Added 5 differential tests asserting bitwise-identical output vs. the
  Burn/NdArray reference (center sample, exact corner, negative-coordinate
  extrapolation, beyond-extent extrapolation, multi-batch/multi-point grid).
- [x] Verified: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-interpolation --features coeus`
  129/129 (124 pre-existing + 5 new); default-feature build 124/124
  unaffected; `cargo clippy --all-targets --features coeus -- -D warnings`
  clean (one `identity_op` lint fixed in the new test file); `cargo doc
  --features coeus --no-deps` clean.
- [x] Cargo.lock: discarded transient noise, kept the genuine new
  `ritk-interpolation -> coeus-core` edge plus the already-merged upstream
  coeus 0.5.4->0.5.5 bump (apollo-fft dropped its now-unneeded
  coeus-autograd/coeus-ops/coeus-tensor deps per coeus's merged
  "coeus-fft, Apollo-backed, no autograd" commit) — confirmed via `git log`
  in the coeus repo that this is a real merged change, not live WIP, so the
  lock correctly reflects current reality rather than fighting it.

### Verification gate (Sprint 466)
- [x] All commands above run and green; no test/lint/doc shortcuts taken.
- [x] Scope check: only `ritk-interpolation` touched (Cargo.toml, mod.rs,
  two new files) plus `Cargo.lock`; no other crate's source changed.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open (Sprint 464 finding: 84.1% of
  `transform_3d_chunk` in the coefficients gather+weighted-sum block).
- `MIG-439-03`'s real scope (workspace-wide Burn-caller-graph audit) not yet
  performed.
- Next coeus/leto/hephaestus integration candidates from this sprint's
  survey, unverified until independently checked like the two above:
  `ritk-registration`'s metric compute kernels (histogram/MI/NCC/gradients)
  still Burn-only even with the crate's `coeus` feature covering only
  preprocessing; `ritk-filter` has zero `coeus` feature at all (its FFT
  compute is already Apollo-backed, but morphology/distance-transform/
  convolution kernels are Burn-only) — both plausible next targets, neither
  yet independently verified for feasibility/risk the way this sprint's
  target was.
- MIG-456-04 and `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` remain open, untouched.

## Sprint 465 — MIG-439-03 Rescoped: NdArray-in-Tests Is Load-Bearing, Not Dead Weight
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Foundation — investigation and backlog correction, no code
change

### In-flight plan (Sprint 465)
- [x] MIG-439-03 [minor]: Surveyed `burn_ndarray` usage workspace-wide via a
  subagent; ranked `ritk-jpeg` as the smallest, best-scaffolded candidate
  (7 tests, an existing Coeus feature, burn_ndarray confined to test-only
  backend aliases).
- [x] MIG-439-03 [minor]: Read `crates/ritk-jpeg/src/color.rs`,
  `src/tests.rs`, `src/reader.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, and `Cargo.toml` in full.
  Found: `type TestBackend = NdArray<f32>` instantiates
  `burn::tensor::backend::Backend` to exercise the crate's still-public,
  still-Burn-generic `read_jpeg`/`write_jpeg`/`read_jpeg_color_to_volume`.
  Coeus (`coeus-core`/`coeus-tensor`) does not implement
  `burn::tensor::backend::Backend` and is not meant to — it is a distinct
  tensor stack. There is no value-semantics-preserving swap available here;
  removing the NdArray instantiation would delete coverage for a live
  production API, which is HARD-prohibited.
- [x] MIG-439-03 [minor]: Confirmed `ritk-jpeg` already has the correct
  migration shape for this exact pattern — `read_jpeg_coeus` (Coeus-native,
  `coeus` feature) plus `read_jpeg_coeus_matches_burn` (differential test,
  voxel-identical to the Burn path). This is the template other crates
  should follow, not a gap to close in ritk-jpeg.
- [x] MIG-439-03 [minor]: Rescoped the backlog item — the real "drop
  burn_ndarray" increment requires removing each crate's *production*
  Burn-generic API entirely, which is gated on every workspace caller having
  migrated to the Coeus/Leto-native equivalent first. That is the existing
  MIG-433-06/437-04/439-03 burn-backend-migration family's actual scope
  ([major]-classed, multi-crate), not a single-crate mechanical alias swap.
  Recorded the exact check (does the production fn still bind
  `B: burn::tensor::backend::Backend`?) so a future agent doesn't re-attempt
  the same non-actionable "swap" and doesn't delete test coverage to force
  a checklist item closed.

### Verification gate (Sprint 465)
- [x] No source code changed — `git status`/`git diff` clean on every file
  under `crates/`. Only `backlog.md`, `checklist.md`, `gap_audit.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md` touched.
- [x] No test/build/lint run required for a docs-only backlog correction;
  Sprint 464's verified-clean baseline stands.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- `PERF-432-01` remains open, localized to the gather+weighted-sum block in
  `transform_3d_chunk` (Sprint 464 finding, 84.1% of function time) — needs
  a custom fused burn kernel or an analytic-backward bypass; not a scoped
  increment yet.
- The real Burn→Coeus/Leto backend migration (MIG-433-06/437-04/439-03
  family) remains open at the workspace-caller-graph level: identify which
  crates' *production* Burn-generic functions have zero remaining internal
  callers of the Burn path (all migrated to Coeus-native equivalents) and
  are therefore safe to have their Burn path removed — not yet audited this
  session.
- MIG-456-04 (color-volume Coeus variants + DICOM Coeus reader) and the
  `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` backlog item remain open, untouched
  this session.

## Sprint 464 — PERF-432-01 Precise Op-Level Profiling, One Prior Claim Retracted
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Foundation — deeper measurement, no code change (both attempted
fixes were reverted after verification)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 464)
- [x] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Directly measured the Sprint 463 backlog's "hoist
  static `range`/`i_idx`/`j_idx`/`k_idx`/`zeros` tensors" claim with
  `std::time::Instant` timers wrapping exactly those 5 lines — **0.05%** of
  `transform_3d_chunk`'s time (28.4ms / 58.9s over 200 calls). That claim was
  reasoned from reading the code, not measured, and is now **retracted** —
  do not implement it.
- [x] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Section-by-section instrumentation of the whole
  `transform_3d_chunk` body (5 buckets) found the cost concentrated in the
  final gather+weighted-sum block: grid_mask 1.3%, basis 0.8%, weights 4.5%,
  index 9.3%, **gather_sum 84.1%** (43.86s/52.2s over 200 calls). That block
  gathers `t.coefficients` (the only differentiable `Param`) at 64
  neighboring control points per query point — burn's autodiff backward for
  it is a scatter-add over 64,000 indices, the likely reason `backward` is
  45% of the outer loop.
- [x] Retracted the previously-filed "cache `MeanSquaredError::forward`'s
  fixed-grid recompute" item's confidence — it was ALSO reasoned, not
  measured, same mistake pattern. Downgraded from "verified next increment"
  to "open, unmeasured hypothesis" in backlog.md.
- [x] Fully reverted all temporary instrumentation (`dim3.rs`, Cargo.lock);
  no source files changed this sprint.

### Verification gate (Sprint 464)
- [x] `git status`/`git diff` clean after reverting instrumentation.
- [x] Confirmed `bspline_registers_offset_sphere` still passes at the
  unmodified baseline (no config/code change survived).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch] remains OPEN. Precisely localized (gather+weighted-
  sum block, `crates/ritk-transform/src/transform/bspline/interpolation/
  dim3.rs`) but the real fix — a custom fused gather+weighted-sum kernel, or
  bypassing burn's generic autodiff for this hot path with a hand-derived
  analytic backward — is an architectural change beyond a scoped patch; filed
  as an investigation target (quantify whether a hand-written CPU
  gather-weighted-sum is worth its correctness-verification cost), not a
  ready increment.

- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.
- [ ] BACKLOG: Wire `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` into a UI feature or remove.

## Sprint 463 — PERF-432-01 Profiling: Bottleneck Located, One Approach Rejected
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Foundation — evidence gathered, no code change (both attempted
fixes were reverted after verification; see rationale below)

### In-flight plan (Sprint 463)
- [x] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Profile `bspline_registers_offset_sphere` with
  temporary `std::time::Instant` timers (flamegraph/perf/samply unavailable
  or impractical on this Windows/MSYS host) — forward ≈42%, backward ≈45%,
  optimizer step + scalar extraction <0.1% of the ~87s loop. Bottleneck is
  the metric-forward/autodiff-backward tensor graph (~30 chained burn ops in
  `BSplineTransform::transform_3d_chunk` per call), consistent with why the
  prior "fused MSE interpolation" op-count reduction got a real but partial
  win.
- [x] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Attempted and **rejected** a
  `ConvergenceChecker`-based early-stop (loss-plateau detection) — simulated
  offline against the full 200-iteration loss curve, wired in the config that
  the simulation showed would trigger at iteration 90 (0.4% higher loss than
  the iteration-199 floor), and it **failed the test's accuracy assertion**
  (err_x 0.668 vs 0.342, threshold 0.5). Root cause: aggregate MSE loss
  plateaus while the specific control points governing the asserted query
  point are still refining — aggregate-loss convergence is not a safe proxy
  for this test's single-point geometric assertion. Fully reverted (test
  file, engine.rs instrumentation, Cargo.lock) to the clean original state.
- [x] Documented two concrete, verified, lower-risk op-count-reduction
  opportunities (redundant fixed-grid recompute in `MeanSquaredError::
  forward`; static index tensors rebuilt every call in
  `transform_3d_chunk`) in backlog.md as the next real increment.

### Verification gate (Sprint 463)
- [x] Confirmed `bspline_registers_offset_sphere` passes unchanged at
  baseline (200 iterations, no config change) after reverting.
- [x] `git status` / `git diff` clean — no source files modified; this
  sprint is audit/evidence-only.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch] remains OPEN. Next increment (see backlog.md for
  full detail): (1) cache the iteration-invariant fixed-image grid in
  `MeanSquaredError::forward` instead of recomputing it 200×/call — requires
  a design decision on trait-level caching vs. hoisting, since it touches
  every `Metric` implementor; (2) hoist the 5 static index/mask tensors in
  `transform_3d_chunk` to a per-`BSplineTransform` cache (zero value-risk,
  removes 5 of ~30 ops/call); (3) further fusion of the basis-weight outer
  product and gather-weighted-sum, the same direction as the prior partial
  "fused MSE interpolation" win.

- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.

## Sprint 462 — Workspace-Wide Orphaned-Module Sweep (SEC-461-04)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — corrected tooling-based sweep, all 14 candidates triaged

### In-flight plan (Sprint 462)
- [x] SEC-461-04 [patch]: Build a correct per-file Rust module-resolution
  checker (mod.rs/lib.rs vs leaf-file semantics; `#[path]` incl. `../`
  traversal via `realpath -m`) — the basename heuristic from Sprint 461 was
  abandoned as too noisy; this one converged after 4 iterations of bug fixes,
  down from 105 candidates to 14 trustworthy ones.
- [x] CHORE-462-01 [patch]: Triage all 14 candidates individually (content
  diff against the active module / caller search) and act:
  - Deleted 9 confirmed-dead files (6 exact test duplicates, 1 scratch
    artifact, 1 redundant shim + its Cargo dep).
  - Restored 4 genuinely orphaned, never-duplicated modules (wired + built +
    tested): ritk-minc tests_spatial (5 tests), ritk-interpolation dispatch
    routing tests (3 tests), ritk-registration direct_phase_fourteen_tests
    (24 tests), ritk-registration metric::dl_losses (4 fns + 5 new tests).
  - Deferred 1 (ritk-snap coordinate_system.rs): real, tested utility with no
    UI consumer — filed as backlog rather than wired speculatively.

### Verification gate (Sprint 462)
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-minc -p ritk-interpolation
  -p ritk-registration -p ritk-core` -> 867 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-cli -p ritk-interpolation -p ritk-io
  -p ritk-png -p ritk-tiff -p ritk-model -p ritk-core` -> 773 passed
  (deletion-affected crates; confirms no coverage loss)
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean across all 9
  touched crates
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt --check` clean across all 9 touched crates

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] BACKLOG: Wire `ritk-snap::ui::coordinate_system` (LPS/RAS conversion +
  DICOM patient-position formatting, fully tested) into an actual coordinate
  readout UI feature, or remove if the display feature is never built.
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect.
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.
- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.

## Sprint 461 — Restore Orphaned DICOM color_multiframe Module
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — orphaned module restored; both color loaders bounded

### In-flight plan (Sprint 461)
- [x] SEC-460-03 [patch]: Bound the DICOM color-series and color-multiframe
  `vec![0.0; total_samples]` eager allocations.
- [x] BUG-461-01 [patch] (discovered mid-task): `color_multiframe.rs` was
  silently dropped from `dicom/mod.rs` by an unrelated ritk-snap refactor
  (152b7b55) — fully dead code (uncompiled, untested, unreachable) since.
  Restored `mod color_multiframe;` + `pub use` re-export.
- [x] TEST-461-02 [patch]: Hostile-dimension regression
  (60000×60000×2 frames, 12 real bytes -> typed error, not OOM) for the
  multiframe path; verified the underlying native decode already
  bounds-checks the byte range so the fix is fully effective.
- [x] CHORE-461-03 [patch]: Fix pre-existing rustfmt drift in
  color_multiframe.rs (never fmt-checked while orphaned).

### Verification gate (Sprint 461)
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-io` -> 344 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy -p ritk-io --lib --tests -- -D warnings`
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt -p ritk-io --check`
- [x] RITK: `cargo doc -p ritk-io --no-deps` (warning-clean)

### Process note
- Attempted a workspace-wide basename-heuristic sweep for other orphaned
  modules; abandoned as too noisy (many files legitimately share basenames —
  `tests.rs`, `helpers.rs` — referenced via relative `#[path]` from different
  parents). Filed as SEC-461-04: a proper sweep needs AST/tooling support
  (e.g. `cargo modules`, `cargo-udeps`), not basename matching.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] SEC-461-04 [patch]: Tooling-based orphaned-module sweep (see note above).
- [ ] TEST-461-05 [patch]: Hostile-dimension regression for the color-series
  path (color/mod.rs) — structurally identical to the multiframe one added
  this sprint; lower priority since the underlying mechanism is proven safe.
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect.
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.
- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.

## Sprint 460 — Workspace Unblock + DICOM Multiframe Alloc Bound
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — apollo-fft co-evolution resolved; multiframe DoS bounded

### In-flight plan (Sprint 460)
- [x] FIX-460-01 [patch]: Resolve the workspace build break — apollo-fft migrated
  to `eunomia::Complex`; migrate ritk-filter's FFT modules off `num_complex`
  (10 files, drop num-complex dep). [BLOCKER — committed and pushed first.]
- [x] SEC-460-02 [patch]: Bound `load_dicom_multiframe`'s up-front
  `n_frames*rows*cols` reservation (checked_mul + `bounded_capacity`).

### Verification gate (Sprint 460)
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter {fft,deconv,correlation,ncc}` -> 111 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-io multiframe` -> 27 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy -p ritk-filter --all-targets -- -D warnings`; `-p ritk-io --lib`
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt -p ritk-filter -p ritk-io --check`

### Co-evolution note
- apollo (upstream, separate repo) changed `apollo-fft`'s public Complex type;
  ritk (consumer) was left unbuilt. Resolved on the ritk side per the
  co-evolution protocol. The num_complex→eunomia swap also advances the Atlas
  vocabulary migration.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] SEC-460-03 [patch]: Bound the DICOM color/color-multiframe `vec![0.0;
  total_samples]` full allocations (checked_mul present; eager-alloc-from-header
  remains — needs incremental build or a pixel-data-length bound).
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect.
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.
- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.

## Sprint 459 — MINC Shape-Exceeds-Data Regression (TEST-447-05)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — MINC bounded-read hardening now has format-level coverage

### In-flight plan (Sprint 459)
- [x] TEST-459-01 [patch]: Forge a shape≠data MINC2 file via `write_minc2_hdf5`
  and assert `read_minc` errors (not OOM), exercising `read_bounded_with`.

### Verification gate (Sprint 459)
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt -p ritk-minc --check`
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-minc` -> 37 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy -p ritk-minc --all-targets -- -D warnings`

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect
  (oldest open perf item; prior fused-MSE/identity-direction attempts did not
  close the 30s budget).
- [ ] SEC-459-02 [patch]: Audit the DICOM-level `PixelLayout` (Rows×Columns)
  construction for an upstream pixel-count bound feeding the codecs.
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.
- [ ] MIG-433-06 / MIG-437-04 / MIG-439-03 [minor]: burn→Atlas backend migration.

## Sprint 458 — JPEG/J2K Decode Dimension Bounds (SSOT)
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — codec decode pixel-bound consolidated to one helper

### In-flight plan (Sprint 458)
- [x] SEC-458-01 [patch]: Add `dimensions::checked_pixel_count` SSOT helper
  (256 Mi cap, `checked_mul`) with unit tests.
- [x] SEC-458-02 [patch]: Route jpeg_ls (replacing its local const), baseline
  JPEG (`frame.sof` dims), and JPEG 2000 (`layout` dims) through it.
- [x] TEST-458-03 [patch]: Helper unit tests + retained JPEG-LS regression.

### Verification gate (Sprint 458)
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt -p ritk-codecs --check`
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-codecs` -> 256 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy -p ritk-codecs --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [x] RITK: `cargo test --doc -p ritk-codecs`

### Codec safety sweep — complete
- Allocation/decode-dimension DoS bounded across all RITK image decoders:
  jpeg_ls, baseline/lossless JPEG, JPEG 2000 (+ the format readers, Sprints 446–447).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] TEST-447-05 [patch]: MINC format-level hostile-fixture regression.
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect.
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.

## Sprint 457 — JPEG-LS Decode DoS Hardening
**Target version**: 0.14.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — codec safety audit + hostile-dimension guard landed

### In-flight plan (Sprint 457)
- [x] SEC-457-01 [patch]: Audit codec parsers/decoders for untrusted-input
  panics and unbounded allocation. jpeg_ls/parser bounds-guards are sound;
  found `decode_fragment` sizing buffers from unbounded SOF55 dimensions.
- [x] SEC-457-02 [patch]: Add `MAX_DECODED_PIXELS` + `checked_mul` guard in
  `JpegLsDecoder::decode_fragment` before per-pixel allocation.
- [x] TEST-457-03 [patch]: Oversized-dimension regression (65535² → typed error,
  not OOM).

### Verification gate (Sprint 457)
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt -p ritk-codecs --check`
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-codecs` -> 253 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo clippy -p ritk-codecs --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- [x] RITK: `cargo test --doc -p ritk-codecs`

### Audit notes (no change required)
- jpeg_ls/parser.rs marker parsers each bounds-check before fixed-offset reads.
- jpeg_2000 has openjp2 differential interop tests (`jpeg2000_interop`).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] SEC-457-04 [patch]: Audit jpeg (baseline) and jpeg_2000 decoders for the
  same dimension-driven allocation pattern (SOF/SIZ width×height).
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants; DICOM Coeus reader.
- [ ] TEST-447-05 [patch]: MINC format-level hostile-fixture regression.

## Sprint 456 — TIFF Coeus Reader Path (grayscale frontier complete)
**Target version**: 0.14.0 (minor: additive public API)
**Sprint phase**: Closure — TIFF Coeus path landed; grayscale reader frontier done

### In-flight plan (Sprint 456)
- [x] MIG-456-01 [minor]: Extract backend-agnostic `decode_tiff_from_reader`
  (page decode + dimension validation) shared by Burn and Coeus.
- [x] MIG-456-02 [minor]: Add `coeus` feature + `read_tiff_coeus`; re-export.
- [x] TEST-456-03 [minor]: Burn/Coeus differential test.

- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-tiff` -> 16 passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-tiff --features coeus` -> 17 passed

### Milestone
- Grayscale single-image/volume Coeus reader paths complete:
  **mgh, nifti, metaimage, minc, jpeg, png, tiff**.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-456-04 [minor]: Color-volume Coeus variants across jpeg/png/tiff;
  DICOM Coeus reader (separate API surface).

## Sprint 455 — PNG Coeus Reader Paths
**Target version**: 0.14.0 (minor: additive public API)
**Sprint phase**: Closure — PNG single + series Coeus paths landed

### In-flight plan (Sprint 455)
- [x] MIG-455-01 [minor]: Extract backend-agnostic `decode_png_single`/

### In-flight plan (Sprint 448)
- [x] ARCH-448-01 [patch]: Audit the workspace for files exceeding the 500-line

  along genuine concern boundaries (byte codec / validation / narrowing / type),
  preserving the `crate::header` surface and narrowing helpers to `pub(super)`.
- [x] TEST-448-03 [patch]: Relocate validation unit tests beside the validation
  code; round-trip tests stay with the codec in `mod.rs`.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] TEST-447-05 [patch]: Format-level hostile-fixture regression for the MINC
  reader (requires forging an HDF5 dataset with shape > backing bytes; the

- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Remaining B-spline registration runtime defect.
- [ ] MIG-433-06 [minor]: Migrate registration N4 bias correction to a

  `compute_from_values` preserves caller input order while the owned path may
  reorder internally for percentile selection.

  reject it after focused timing showed `bspline_registers_offset_sphere`
  regressed to 78.925s.

## Sprint 435 — Fused MSE Interpolation Cleanup
**Target version**: 0.13.10
**Sprint phase**: Closure — MSE uses dimension-generic fused interpolation, B-spline remains over budget

### In-flight plan (Sprint 435)
- [x] PERF-435-01 [patch]: Audit the remaining MSE B-spline row and confirm
  the unfused MSE path still materializes transform-to-index intermediates.
- [x] PERF-435-02 [patch]: Generalize the existing fused
  transform-to-index-to-linear-interpolation helper from 3D-only to
  dimension-generic operation.
- [x] PERF-435-03 [patch]: Route `MeanSquaredError` through the fused helper so
  moving-index materialization is centralized and reused instead of open-coded
  in the metric.
- [x] TEST-435-04 [patch]: Add 2D value-semantic OOB mask coverage for the
  inner-most-first column convention.
- [ ] PERF-435-05 [patch]: Continue optimizing

## Sprint 434 — Registration Convergence Runtime Budget
**Target version**: 0.13.9
**Sprint phase**: Closure — CR integration tests use corrected convergence semantics

### In-flight plan (Sprint 434)
- [x] PERF-434-01 [patch]: Audit the three PERF-432 slow registration rows and
  identify the Correlation Ratio rows as safe convergence-policy candidates.
- [x] FIX-434-02 [patch]: Correct `ConvergenceChecker` so a current best loss
  counts as improvement instead of immediate convergence after the patience
  window fills.
- [x] API-434-03 [minor]: Add `MultiResolutionRegistration::with_registration_config`
  so multires callers can apply the same validated registration loop policy at
  every level.
- [x] PERF-434-04 [patch]: Apply the corrected convergence policy to the
  B-spline CR and multires CR integration tests without weakening their
  value-semantic transform assertions.
- [ ] PERF-434-05 [patch]: Optimize `bspline_registers_offset_sphere`; this
  MSE B-spline row remains above the strict 60s termination budget at 87.615s
  and needs a production hot-path fix rather than convergence-window truncation.

### Verification gate (Sprint 434)
- [x] RITK: `cargo nextest run -p ritk-registration --features coeus bspline_registers_offset_sphere test_bspline_cr_registration_small test_multires_cr_registration` -> 3 passed; CR rows reduced to 17.908s and 22.531s, MSE B-spline row remained above budget in follow-up experiments

### In-flight plan (Sprint 433)
- [x] MIG-433-01 [minor]: Audit the remaining Coeus preprocessing filter-backed
  steps and select Gaussian smoothing as the bounded migration slice; N4 remains
  a larger bias-field filter migration.
- [x] MIG-433-02 [patch]: Extend the existing Moirai-backed
  `deformable_field_ops` Gaussian smoothing primitive with per-axis voxel
  sigmas so image spacing is handled without cloning convolution logic.
- [x] MIG-433-03 [minor]: Route Coeus preprocessing `Smoothing` through
  `ritk_tensor_ops::coeus` extraction/rebuild and the Moirai Gaussian smoothing
  SSOT with executor-reused scratch storage.
- [x] MIG-433-04 [patch]: Add value-semantic tests for constant preservation,
  impulse smoothing, non-finite sigma rejection, N4 rejection, and smoothing
  value-count validation.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-433-06 [minor]: Migrate registration N4 bias correction to a
  Coeus/Leto/Hephaestus-backed bias-field implementation before the Coeus
  preprocessing executor can run every preprocessing step.
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Profile and reduce long-running registration
  integration tests currently covered by `.config/nextest.toml` 600s overrides;
  the latest full package run passed but still violates the stricter 30s/60s
  AGENTS.md budget.

## Sprint 432 — Coeus Registration Preprocessing Scalar Consumer
**Target version**: 0.13.7
**Sprint phase**: Closure — registration scalar preprocessing has a Coeus image path

### In-flight plan (Sprint 432)
- [x] MIG-432-01 [minor]: Audit remaining production Burn image consumers and
  select `ritk-registration::preprocessing` as the next bounded Coeus image
  consumer because clamp, masking, and intensity normalization are scalar
  buffer transforms.
- [x] MIG-432-02 [patch]: Extract scalar preprocessing value semantics into a
  shared `value_ops` leaf so the Burn executor and Coeus executor use one
  implementation for normalization, clamping, masking, and mask validation.
- [x] MIG-432-03 [minor]: Add a feature-gated Coeus preprocessing executor for
  scalar-safe steps over `ritk_image::coeus::Image<f32, B, 3>`.
- [x] MIG-432-04 [patch]: Route Coeus extraction and rebuild through
  `ritk_tensor_ops::coeus` image helpers so rank, contiguity, metadata, and
  shape-product validation stay centralized.
- [x] MIG-432-05 [patch]: Add value-semantic Coeus tests for clamp metadata
  preservation, masking, exact min-max values, unsupported filter-backed step
  diagnostics, and checked mask-product overflow.
- [x] MIG-432-06 [patch]: Verify focused compile, format, clippy, nextest,
  doctest, docs, and diff hygiene with `--features coeus`.

- [x] RITK: `cargo doc -p ritk-registration --features coeus --no-deps` -> passed
- [x] RITK: `git diff --check` -> passed

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [x] MIG-432-07 [minor]: Migrate registration Gaussian smoothing to the Coeus
  preprocessing executor. Closed by Sprint 433 using the Moirai Gaussian
  smoothing SSOT; N4 remains MIG-433-06.
- [ ] PERF-432-01 [patch]: Profile and reduce long-running registration
  integration tests currently covered by `.config/nextest.toml` 600s overrides;
  the full package run passed but violates the stricter 30s/60s AGENTS.md
  budget.

## Sprint 431 — Coeus Statistics Image Consumer
**Target version**: 0.13.6
**Sprint phase**: Closure — first production image consumer has a Coeus image path

### In-flight plan (Sprint 431)
- [x] MIG-431-01 [minor]: Audit production image consumers and choose
  `ritk-statistics::image_statistics` as the first bounded Coeus image
  consumer because the statistics algorithm already has a slice-level SSOT.
- [x] MIG-431-02 [minor]: Add feature-gated
  `ritk_statistics::image_statistics::coeus` functions for Coeus-backed
  `compute_statistics` and `masked_statistics`.
- [x] MIG-431-03 [patch]: Route Coeus image extraction through the Sprint 430
  `ritk_tensor_ops::coeus` image helpers so rank, contiguity, and shape-product
  validation stay centralized.

  Burn-backed image statistics path plus a fallible empty-mask diagnostic test.
- [x] MIG-431-05 [patch]: Verify focused compile, format, clippy, nextest,

## Sprint 430 — Coeus Image Tensor-Ops Boundary
**Target version**: 0.13.5
**Sprint phase**: Closure — Coeus image-level tensor-ops helpers added and verified

### In-flight plan (Sprint 430)
- [x] MIG-430-01 [minor]: Audit the remaining Burn image helper dependency and
  identify `ritk-tensor-ops` as the narrow migration seam for Coeus image
  callers.
- [x] MIG-430-02 [minor]: Add feature-gated
  `ritk_tensor_ops::coeus::{extract_image_slice, extract_image_vec,
  rebuild_image}` for `ritk_image::coeus::Image<T, B, D>`.
- [x] MIG-430-03 [patch]: Keep tensor rank, contiguity, and shape-product
  validation delegated to the existing Coeus tensor helpers so the image-level
  API has one validation SSOT.
- [x] MIG-430-04 [patch]: Add value-semantic tests for Coeus image borrowed
  extraction, owned extraction, rebuild metadata preservation, shape mismatch,
  and exact negative-path diagnostics.

## Sprint 429 — Coeus Image Contract
**Target version**: 0.13.4
**Sprint phase**: Closure — Coeus-backed image metadata contract added and verified

### In-flight plan (Sprint 429)
- [x] MIG-429-01 [minor]: Audit `ritk-image` Burn-backed public root and
  identify an additive Coeus-native image contract that does not break existing
  callers.
- [x] MIG-429-02 [minor]: Add feature-gated `ritk_image::coeus::Image<T, B, D>`
  over `coeus_tensor::Tensor<T, B>` with checked rank construction, metadata
  accessors, ownership-preserving decomposition, and contiguous host slice
  borrowing for CPU-addressable backends.
- [x] MIG-429-03 [patch]: Add value-semantic tests for metadata preservation,

## Sprint 428 — Coeus Tensor-Ops Host Boundary
**Target version**: 0.13.3
**Sprint phase**: Closure — Coeus tensor host extraction/rebuild boundary added and verified

### In-flight plan (Sprint 428)
- [x] MIG-428-01 [minor]: Audit `ritk-tensor-ops` Burn-shaped production
  boundary and identify a safe Coeus-native increment that does not force
  `ritk-image::Image<B, D>` migration prematurely.
- [x] MIG-428-02 [minor]: Add feature-gated `ritk_tensor_ops::coeus` helpers
  for borrowed contiguous extraction, owned extraction, and checked tensor
  rebuild.
- [x] MIG-428-03 [patch]: Add value-semantic Coeus tests for zero-copy borrow,

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [x] MIG-428-05 [minor]: Add a complete Coeus-backed image contract before
  removing the legacy Burn `Image` helpers from `ritk-tensor-ops`. Closed by
  Sprint 429; caller migration and Burn helper deletion remain MIG-429-06.

## Sprint 427 — Coeus Tensor-Ops Contract Tests
**Target version**: 0.13.2
**Sprint phase**: Closure — Coeus feature contract tests deduplicated and value-semantic

### In-flight plan (Sprint 427)
- [x] MIG-427-01 [patch]: Audit `ritk-tensor-ops` Coeus feature tests for
  duplicated setup and weak assertions.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue replacing production Burn tensor boundaries
  with Coeus only where a complete tensor/image contract and focused tests are
  available. This slice strengthens the Coeus contract tests and does not claim

  `brain_fixed.nii.gz` / `brain_moving.nii.gz` pair is documented as an
  ANTs/MNI152 source copy, not a meaningful registration-quality pair.
- [x] MIG-426-05 [patch]: Verify focused NIfTI compile, clippy, nextest,
  doctest, docs, and structural audits after provider graph reconciliation.

### Verification gate (Sprint 426)

---

## Sprint 425 — Native NIfTI-2 Single-File Codec
**Target version**: 0.13.0
**Sprint phase**: Closure — `ritk-nifti` reads and writes NIfTI-2 single-file streams

### In-flight plan (Sprint 425)
- [x] MIG-425-01 [minor]: Separate Analyze `.hdr`/`.img` ownership from NIfTI
  single-file work; `ritk-analyze` remains the Analyze 7.5 pair owner.
- [x] MIG-425-02 [minor]: Refactor `ritk-nifti` header state into one versioned
  SSOT covering NIfTI-1 and NIfTI-2 dimensions, datatype validation, endian
  detection, spatial fields, and checked payload ranges.
- [x] MIG-425-03 [minor]: Add explicit NIfTI-2 image and label writers while
  keeping existing `write_nifti` / `write_nifti_labels` as NIfTI-1 emitters.
- [x] MIG-425-04 [patch]: Make payload reads endian-aware through header-owned
  lane decoders.
- [x] MIG-425-05 [patch]: Add value-semantic NIfTI-2 image/header and

  --glob 'Cargo.toml'` -> no `nifti-rs` dependency or API use; `burn-ndarray`
  remains only as the test backend and crate docs mention ndarray as a removed
  conversion surface.
- [x] Format-boundary audit: `rg 'n\+2|ni2|Analyze|\.hdr|\.img|write_nifti2|HeaderVersion'
  crates/ritk-nifti/src crates/ritk-analyze/src --glob '*.rs'` -> `ritk-nifti`
  owns NIfTI-2 single-file `n+2`; `ritk-analyze` owns Analyze 7.5 `.hdr/.img`;
  paired NIfTI `ni1`/`ni2` remains deferred as a distinct NIfTI variant.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-425-01 [minor]: Add paired NIfTI `ni1`/`ni2` `.hdr`/`.img` support if a
  caller needs NIfTI pairs; do not route Analyze 7.5 through `ritk-nifti`.

  images and UInt32/Float32 labels when a caller needs additional scalar kinds.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue Burn/Coeus tensor replacement as a separate

## Sprint 411 — SNAP Spatial Dependency Cleanup
**Target version**: 0.12.86
**Sprint phase**: Closure — SNAP volume spatial metadata now routes through the spatial SSOT

### In-flight plan (Sprint 411)
- [x] MIG-387-02 [patch]: Audit `ritk-snap` for direct `nalgebra` usage and confirm
  it is limited to spatial direction construction.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-387-02 [arch]: Continue mesh-only spatial cleanup. Gaia-backed mesh paths

  separate contract-preserving slices.

## Sprint 410 — PNG Spatial Dependency Cleanup
**Target version**: 0.12.85
**Sprint phase**: Closure — PNG default spatial metadata tests now use the spatial SSOT

### Delivered (Sprint 410)
- [x] MIG-387-02 [patch]: **`ritk-png` no longer depends on `nalgebra`** —
  PNG grayscale default-metadata tests now compare against
  `ritk_spatial::Direction::identity()` instead of `nalgebra::SMatrix`, and the
  crate's dev-dependency plus lockfile edge were removed.

### Verification gate (Sprint 410)
- [x] RITK: `cargo check -p ritk-png --all-targets` -> passed
- [x] RITK: `cargo fmt --check -p ritk-png` -> passed

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-387-02 [arch]: Continue SNAP and mesh-only spatial cleanup. Gaia-backed
  mesh paths still use Gaia's current `Point3r`/`nalgebra::Point3` public contract,
  so those require either a Gaia API extension or a mesh-bounded RITK slice.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue Burn/Coeus and `ndarray` boundary migration as

## Sprint 409 — DICOM/MINC/Filter Spatial Leto Slice
**Target version**: 0.12.84
**Sprint phase**: Closure — DICOM, MINC, and filter spatial metadata paths now use the Leto-backed spatial SSOT

### Delivered (Sprint 409)
- [x] MIG-387-02 [arch]: **DICOM spatial metadata no longer constructs directions through `nalgebra`** —
  scalar, RGB, multiframe, and series loaders now route column-major metadata and
  orientation-derived axes through `ritk_spatial::Direction`, `Point`, and `Vector`.
- [x] MIG-409-01 [patch]: **`ritk-spatial::Vector` owns 3-D direction math needed by format readers** —
  added value-semantic `dot`, `normalized`, and 3-D `cross` operations over the
  existing Leto-backed storage.
- [x] MIG-409-02 [patch]: **MINC spatial read/write paths use `Direction<3>` directly** —
  removed the direct `nalgebra` dependency from `ritk-minc`; the HDF5 writer now
  accepts `Direction<3>` and writes direction cosines from the spatial SSOT.
- [x] MIG-409-03 [patch]: **Filter spatial transforms stop mixing nalgebra with `Direction`** —
  transform-geometry, DICOM-orient, permute-axes, ROI, and unsharp-mask metadata
  fixtures now use `Direction`, `Point`, and `Vector` directly.

### Verification gate (Sprint 409)
- [x] RITK: `cargo check -p ritk-spatial -p ritk-minc -p ritk-filter -p ritk-io --all-targets` -> passed

- [x] RITK: `cargo doc -p ritk-spatial -p ritk-minc -p ritk-filter -p ritk-io --no-deps` -> passed

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-387-02 [arch]: Continue PNG/SNAP and mesh-only spatial cleanup in
  separate bounded-context slices; `ritk-io` still has VTK mesh test `nalgebra`
  use and keeps its manifest dependency until that mesh slice is migrated.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue Burn/Coeus migration as a separate tensor-boundary
  redesign; Burn remains a public backend/tensor contract across image, filter,
  registration, model, IO, and Python crates.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue `ndarray` boundary audit for NIfTI/file-format
  conversion and Python/numpy boundary code.

## Sprint 408 — Spatial Leto SSOT Slice
**Target version**: 0.12.83
**Sprint phase**: Execution — `ritk-spatial` storage migrated to Leto fixed primitives; format/core call sites updated

### Delivered (Sprint 408)
- [x] MIG-387-02 [arch]: **`ritk-spatial` no longer depends on `nalgebra`** —
  `Point`, `Vector`, and `Direction` now store Leto stack-backed
  `FixedVector`/`FixedMatrix` values. Direction determinant, inverse, column
  extraction, row-major/column-major 3-D conversion, and serde boundary
  serialization remain real implementations with value-semantic tests.
- [x] MIG-408-01 [patch]: **Medical-image spatial adapters use the spatial SSOT** —
  `ritk-core`, `ritk-metaimage`, `ritk-nrrd`, `ritk-nifti`, and `ritk-mgh`
  no longer declare direct `nalgebra` dependencies for spatial direction setup.
  Their tests now construct directions through `ritk_spatial::Direction`.
- [x] LOCK-408-01 [patch]: **RITK lockfile matches the current local Coeus provider** —
  verification refreshed Coeus path-package lock entries from `0.2.8` to `0.2.10`.

### Verification gate (Sprint 408)

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] MIG-387-02 [arch]: Continue DICOM IO geometry, MINC, PNG/SNAP/filter
  spatial call-site cleanup in a separate slice after this spatial SSOT merge.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue Burn/Coeus migration as a separate tensor-boundary

## Sprint 407 — Leto Classical Registration Slice
**Target version**: 0.12.82
**Sprint phase**: Closure — classical registration nalgebra island migrated to Leto fixed math and Leto-ops SVD

### Delivered (Sprint 407)
- [x] MIG-387-01 [patch]: **Classical landmark registration no longer depends on
  `nalgebra`** — `ritk-registration` rigid/affine perturbation composition,
  point-cloud centroids, Kabsch rotation construction, landmark translation, and FRE
  now use Leto stack-backed `FixedMatrix`/`FixedVector` primitives. Kabsch singular
  vectors route through `leto_ops::svd_rank_revealing`, preserving the real SVD
  computation while removing the production `nalgebra` dependency from this crate.
- [x] MIG-407-01 [patch]: **Degenerate identical landmark sets are deterministic** —
  exact identical centered point sets now return the identity rotation before SVD.
  This records the mathematically exact zero-residual solution instead of relying on
  a non-unique rank-deficient SVD nullspace basis.
- [x] LOCK-407-01 [patch]: **RITK lockfile matches the current local Coeus provider** —
  verification refreshed Coeus path-package lock entries from `0.2.6` to `0.2.8`.
  Evidence tier: dependency metadata plus compile/lint/doc/test gates.

### Verification gate (Sprint 407)

## Sprint 406 — Global Format Gate
**Target version**: 0.12.81
**Sprint phase**: Closure — repo-wide rustfmt drift corrected; doc gate blocked by dirty Coeus provider

### Delivered (Sprint 406)
- [x] FMT-406-01 [patch]: **Repo-wide `cargo fmt --check` gate is restored** —
  apply the committed `rustfmt` style to the stale formatting drift previously blocking
  full-repo format verification across `ritk-core`, `ritk-filter`, `ritk-interpolation`,
  `ritk-registration`, `ritk-segmentation`, and `ritk-tensor-ops`.
- [x] LOCK-406-01 [patch]: **RITK lockfile matches the current local Coeus provider** —
  refresh Coeus path-package lock entries from `0.2.4` to `0.2.6` so
  `cargo metadata --locked` is consistent with `D:\atlas\repos\coeus`.
  Evidence tier: dependency metadata verification.

### Verification gate (Sprint 406)

- [ ] `cargo doc -p ritk-core -p ritk-filter -p ritk-interpolation -p ritk-registration -p ritk-segmentation -p ritk-tensor-ops --no-deps` -> blocked by the same `coeus-autograd` compile errors

### Deferred / carry-forward

  (`test_bspline_cr_registration_small` 161s, `test_multires_cr_registration` 116s,
  `bspline_registers_offset_sphere` 81s, plus several 30s-40s rigid/affine/versor rows).
- [ ] PERF-392-02 [patch]: Continue flat-buffer audit with public VTK cell-list storage
  only after an ADR/migration plan, because `VtkPolyData`/`VtkUnstructuredGrid` expose
  nested cell vectors as public fields.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue replacing remaining `nalgebra`/`ndarray`/`burn`
  production surfaces with `leto`/`coeus`/`hephaestus` only where the Atlas crate has
  an equivalent verified contract.
- [ ] MIG-406-01 [patch]: Remove stale `rayon` wording from comments/docs where production

### Delivered (Sprint 405)
- [x] SAFE-405-01 [patch]: **FFT convolution padding is checked before allocation** —
  centralize 2-D/3-D boundary-padding and FFT-padding shape arithmetic for convolution and
  normalized cross-correlation. The shared helper rejects zero input dimensions,
  `usize` addition/multiplication overflow, and non-representable power-of-two FFT extents
  before allocating complex buffers. Edge-replication indexing no longer casts `usize` to
  `isize`; it uses bounded `usize` arithmetic.
  Evidence tier: compile/lint/docs plus value-semantic helper and FFT regression tests.

### Verification gate (Sprint 405)
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` -> blocked by pre-existing unrelated formatting drift outside this
  slice (`ritk-core`, `ritk-filter` deconvolution/diffusion, `ritk-interpolation`,
  `ritk-segmentation`, `ritk-tensor-ops`)

  only after an ADR/migration plan, because `VtkPolyData`/`VtkUnstructuredGrid` expose
  nested cell vectors as public fields.

## Sprint 404 — Apollo FFT Dependency Cleanup
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — unused `rustfft` workspace dependency removed and FFT docs reconciled

### Delivered (Sprint 404)
- [x] MIG-387-01 [patch]: **FFT stack names Apollo as the canonical backend** —
  removed the unused workspace `rustfft` dependency and replaced stale RITK FFT docs/comments
  that still described `rustfft` semantics. Production FFT helpers already route through
  `apollo_fft::FftPlan1D`, so this slice is dependency and documentation cleanup with
  locked-metadata verification rather than an algorithm rewrite.
  Evidence tier: compile/lint plus dependency graph/search verification.

## Sprint 403 — Vector Confidence Fallibility
**Target version**: ritk-segmentation 0.2.0 / ritk-python 0.12.79
**Sprint phase**: Closure — input-boundary hardening delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 403)
- [x] SAFE-403-01 [major]: **Vector confidence-connected validates channel layout** —
  the slice-level and image-level vector confidence-connected entry points now return
  `Result` instead of panicking or indexing unchecked malformed channel layouts. The core
  validates voxel-count overflow, exact per-channel sample counts, radius conversion, and
  image-channel dimension equality before allocation/indexing. The Python binding maps the
  Rust validation error to `ValueError`.

## Sprint 402 — VTU Exact Cell Arrays
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped VTU parser-safety slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 402)
- [x] SAFE-402-01 [patch]: **VTU cell arrays are exact and fallible** —
  VTU XML parsing now rejects negative `connectivity`, `offsets`, and cell-type values
  before narrowing; rejects decreasing offsets before slice indexing; and requires the
  final offset to consume the connectivity array exactly. This removes signed wraparound,
  malformed-offset panics, and trailing connectivity acceptance at the XML trust boundary.
  Evidence tier: compile/lint plus value-semantic malformed-cell-array tests.

## Sprint 401 — VTK Cell Streaming and Parse Errors
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped VTK memory/safety slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 401)
- [x] PERF-392-02 [patch]: **VTK unstructured cell writers stream from source cells** —
  legacy VTK writing no longer allocates a `Vec<String>` for every cell row, and VTU
  XML writing no longer materializes duplicate flat `connectivity` and `offsets` vectors.
  Both writers emit directly from `VtkUnstructuredGrid::cells`, preserving the public
  `Vec<Vec<u32>>` data model while reducing transient allocation on export.
- [x] SAFE-401-01 [patch]: **Malformed legacy ASCII cell indices are fallible** —
  the legacy unstructured-grid reader now reports malformed `CELLS` point indices with
  cell/position context instead of panicking through `unwrap()`.
  Evidence tier: compile/lint plus value-semantic VTK round-trip and malformed-cell tests.

**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped parser-safety slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 400)
- [x] SAFE-399-01 [patch]: **NIfTI spatial fields are exact and fallible** —
  `ritk-nifti` now rejects non-finite affine entries, zero affine columns, non-positive
  or non-finite spatial `pixdim` values, non-standard qfac values, impossible qform
  quaternion vector norms, and overflowing shape products before allocation. This removes
  silent qform clamping, fallback-axis synthesis, invalid spacing acceptance, and unchecked
  voxel-count multiplication from the NIfTI boundary. Evidence tier: compile/lint plus
  value-semantic malformed-field tests.

### Delivered (Sprint 399)
- [x] SAFE-398-01 [patch]: **MINC dimension attributes are exact and fallible** —
  `ritk-minc` now rejects floating-point dimension lengths, unsigned lengths that exceed
  `i64::MAX`, scalar `direction_cosines`, and `direction_cosines` arrays with any count
  other than exactly three components. This removes silent truncation, unchecked narrowing,
  vector-prefix parsing, and scalar replication from the MINC spatial metadata boundary.

  storage. Evidence tier: compile/lint plus value-semantic round-trip tests.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-391-02 [patch]: Continue flat-buffer audit with `VectorConfidenceConnected` channel
  buffers and VTK public cell-list storage. The VTK cell-list model remains a broader public
  API/storage change and needs an ADR before breaking `Vec<Vec<u32>>` fields.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue replacing remaining `nalgebra`/`ndarray`/`burn` production surfaces

## Sprint 390 — TIFF Flat Page Accumulation
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped memory-efficiency slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 390)
- [x] PERF-390-01 [patch]: **TIFF grayscale/RGB readers append into flat tensor buffers** —
  `ritk-tiff` no longer stages decoded pages in `Vec<Vec<f32>>` before copying into the final
  tensor payload. Grayscale and RGB readers now append each owned decoded page directly into one
  flat `Vec<f32>` and derive `nz`/`depth` from the page counter, preserving IFD order and error
  page indices. Evidence tier: compile/lint plus value-semantic round-trip tests.

## Sprint 389 — Inverse Displacement Coefficient Flattening
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped memory-efficiency slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 389)
- [x] PERF-387-02 [patch]: **`InverseDisplacementField` flat TPS coefficient blocks** —
  the spline coefficient matrix `D` and affine matrix `A` are now stored as flat row-major
  `Vec<f64>` buffers after solving the TPS system. The Moirai evaluation loop reads
  `dmat[t * n_land + i]` and `amat[t * d + j]`, removing the remaining per-row heap
  allocations from this inverse-displacement hot path while preserving f64 arithmetic and
  public image contracts. Evidence tier: compile/lint plus value-semantic focused tests.

### Verification gate (Sprint 389)

## Sprint 388 — Linear Kernel Slice Semantics
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — lint blocker removed and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 388)
- [x] CLIPPY-387-01 [patch]: **Linear kernel batch slicing uses Burn's dimension slice API** —
  2-D, 3-D, and 4-D linear interpolation kernels now split gathered corner batches through
  one parent-module `slice_batch` helper backed by `Tensor::slice_dim(0, start..end)`.
  This preserves the existing gather/lerp computation while removing the `single_range_in_vec_init`
  lint source without allocation or compatibility shims. Evidence tier: compile/lint plus
  value-semantic focused tests.
- [x] CLIPPY-388-02 [patch]: **Level-set chunk loops iterate mutable slices directly** —
  Chan-Vese, geodesic active contour, shape detection, threshold level set, and Laplacian
  update kernels now use `iter_mut().enumerate()` over Moirai-provided chunk slices while
  retaining global indices only for read-only companion buffers. Evidence tier: compile/lint
  plus value-semantic focused tests.
- [x] ATLAS-388-01 [patch]: **Coeus autograd stack/split call-site drift fixed upstream** —
  `D:\atlas\repos\coeus\coeus-autograd\src\ops\shape\stack.rs` now calls
  `coeus_ops::{split,stack}` through their current backend-owning signatures. Evidence tier:
  direct Coeus package Clippy and nextest plus RITK dependency-gate compilation.

## Sprint 387 — Region-Growing Matrix Flattening + Legacy Cleanup
**Target version**: 0.12.80
**Sprint phase**: Closure — scoped memory-efficiency slice delivered and focused verification passed

### Delivered (Sprint 387)
- [x] PERF-387-01 [patch]: **`VectorConfidenceConnected` row-major covariance/inverse** —
  internal covariance, augmented Gauss-Jordan state, inverse covariance, and singular fallback
  now use flat row-major `Vec<f64>` buffers instead of nested `Vec<Vec<f64>>` matrices. Public
  channel input remains unchanged. Evidence tier: differential/value-semantic tests.
- [x] CLEAN-387-01 [patch]: **B-spline dead legacy module removed** — deleted the placeholder
  `bspline/legacy.rs` module and its parent `mod legacy;` declaration. No compatibility shim remains.
- [x] BUILD-387-01 [patch]: **Cargo.lock synchronized with local `moirai` graph** — Cargo now records
  `bytemuck` for local `moirai-core` and `moirai-transport`, matching the current Atlas checkout.
- [x] DOC-387-01 [patch]: **Atlas dependency table reconciled** — README now names `moirai`,
  `mnemosyne`, `apollo-fft`, and Atlas migration targets instead of stale `rayon` guidance.

### Verification gate (Sprint 387)
- [x] `rustfmt crates\ritk-segmentation\src\region_growing\vector_confidence_connected.rs crates\ritk-interpolation\src\interpolation\kernel\bspline\mod.rs`

- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-interpolation bspline` → **25/25 passed**
- [x] `cargo check -p ritk-interpolation` → passed
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` workspace gate blocked by pre-existing formatting drift in unrelated files; not applied to avoid unrelated churn.
- [x] `cargo clippy -p ritk-interpolation --all-targets -- -D warnings` unblocked in Sprint 388
  by replacing the linear-kernel single-range `slice` calls with `Tensor::slice_dim`.

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-387-02 [patch]: Continue flattening small matrix/vector hot paths where API-compatible:
  `vector_confidence_connected` channel buffers, `inverse_displacement` derivative matrices, and
  VTK cell lists are the next audit candidates.
- [x] CLIPPY-387-01 [patch]: Fixed in Sprint 388 without changing tensor slice semantics.
- [ ] MIG-387-01 [arch]: Continue replacing remaining `nalgebra`/`ndarray`/`burn` production surfaces
  with `leto`/`coeus`/`hephaestus` only where the Atlas crate has an equivalent verified contract.

## Sprint 386 — CurvatureFlow f64, Interior Peel Perf, Laplacian Bug Fix, cmake Parity +18
**Target version**: 0.12.79
**Sprint phase**: Closure — all items delivered and verified

### Delivered (Sprint 386)
- [x] CORR-386-01 [major]: **`CurvatureFlowImageFilter` f64 arithmetic** — all stencil
  arithmetic widened to f64 (matching ITK `PixelRealType = double`). Closes 4.3% relative
  divergence. `CurvatureFlow/defaults` and `CurvatureFlow/longer` cmake tests now pass at
  1e-5 tolerance. Interior-peel path + double-buffer pattern added. 2.2× test speedup.
- [x] CORR-386-02 [major]: **`LaplacianLevelSet` d²I/dx² copy-paste bug** — backward
  x-axis neighbour was `idx_clamped(zz, yy-1, xx, ...)` (y-axis); fixed to
  `idx_clamped(zz, yy, xx-1, ...)`. Dice 0.005 → passing at Dice ≥ 0.80.
- [x] BUILD-386-01 [patch]: **Stale wheel rebuilt** — Sprint 385 registered functions
  (`anti_alias_binary`, `canny_segmentation_level_set`, `inverse_displacement_field`,
  `level_set_motion_register`, `min_max_curvature_flow`, `binary_min_max_curvature_flow`,
  `slic`) now present in live module. 15 previously-failing cmake tests pass.
- [x] TEST-386-01 [minor]: **6 new cmake `_CASES`** — `RecursiveGaussian/directional_x`,
  `UnsharpMask/default`, `UnsharpMask/local_contrast`. All pass.
- [x] TEST-386-02 [minor]: **3 new standalone cmake tests** — `MorphologicalGradient`,
  `ConnectedThreshold`, `NeighborhoodConnected`. All bit-exact.

### Delivered (Sprint 385)
- [x] CORR-384-01 [major]: **Frangi + Sato IIR Hessian** — `compute_hessian_iir` added to
  `recursive_gaussian.rs`; `frangi.rs` and `sato.rs` updated to use it. Algebraic identity
  test `test_hessian_iir_laplacian_consistency` verifies `H_zz+H_yy+H_xx = ∇²G` to 1e-3.
- [x] CORR-384-02 [major]: **IsolatedWatershed gradient-descent watershed** — replaced
  ConnectedThreshold BFS with `watershed_basins_gd` (steepest-descent path compression).
  Pixel-perfect match (1.0) vs sitk on 7×7 reference. Python test `test_isolated_watershed_matches_sitk`
  now passes.
- [x] CORR-384-03 [major]: **`ScalarChanAndVeseDenseLevelSet` mu=1.0 + adaptive dt** — `mu`
  default corrected 0.5→1.0 (ITK `CurvatureWeight`); adaptive dt added; Python binding
  exposes `mu` kwarg.
- [x] NEW-384-01 [minor]: **`shift_scale` Python binding** — `ritk.filter.shift_scale` added;
  stub and smoke test updated; cmake parity test `test_cmake_shift_scale_matches_sitk`
  now passes. cmake score: 429→430.
- [x] PERF-384-01 [high]: **`window_cc_stats` O(N·w³)→O(N) SAT** — `CcSats` struct with
  5 f64 SATs, O(N) build, O(1) `query_at`. König–Huygens variance, `.max(0.0)` clamp.
  Differentially verified vs two-pass reference to 1e-9. `cc_forces_into`, `cc_forces`,
  `mean_local_cc` all use SATs.

### Delivered (Sprint 384)
- [x] REG-01 [patch]: **RSGD `prev_loss` not advanced on rejected step** — `optimizer.rs`
  `!improved` branch no longer sets `prev_loss`. New value-semantic test
  `rsgd_prev_loss_not_advanced_on_rejected_step` verifies ITK-correct behaviour.
- [x] C-2 [minor]: **Canny NMS sub-pixel trilinear interpolation** — replaced 26-direction

  one construction per `LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation` instance.
- [x] REG-04 [patch]: **`thirion_forces_into` serial loop** — parallelised via moirai CellSlice.
- [x] REG-07 [patch]: **`compute_masked_joint_histogram` `pts.clone()`** — signature changed to
  `&Tensor<B,2>`; no per-`forward()` clone.
- [x] SEG-02 [patch]: **Level-set helpers serial loops** — `compute_curvature_into`,
  `compute_field_gradient_into`, `upwind_advection_into` parallelised via moirai.
- [x] SEG-05 [patch]: **`local_otsu_threshold` `Vec<f64>[256]` alloc** — eliminated; inline-normalized.

- [x] T-1 [patch]: **Canny value-semantic NMS tests** — `test_canny_2d_step_edge_pixel_count`,
  `test_canny_nms_reduces_thick_edges`.
- [x] T-2 [patch]: **`stencil_radius=0` guard** — `assert!` in both curvature-flow filter `apply`
  methods; panic test added.

  `tests_colormap.rs` (needless range loop), `tests_normalized_correlation.rs` (zero
  multiplication), `tests_fast_chamfer.rs` (zero-effect multiplication),
  `tests_marker_controlled.rs` (iter().any → contains) all resolved.
- [x] CLIP-383-02 [patch]: **`inverse_displacement.rs` Clippy clean** — Replaced
  range-loop with `enumerate().skip()`, used `split_at_mut` for inner elimination loop,
  removed unnecessary `as f64` casts, replaced manual r2 loops with iterator `.sum()`,
  added `#[allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)]` with justification for the voxel-flat-index loop.
- [x] PERF-383-01 [patch]: **`solve_linear` flat matrix** — `Vec<Vec<f64>>` replaced
  with flat row-major `Vec<f64>`; eliminates `sz` heap pointer indirections and
  improves cache locality for row-scan operations.
- [x] PERF-383-02 [patch]: **`InverseDisplacementField` flat landmarks + L-matrix** —
  `src: Vec<Vec<f64>>` and `l: Vec<Vec<f64>>` converted to flat `Vec<f64>`; eliminates
  `n_land + sz` heap pointer indirections per invocation.
- [x] PERF-383-03 [patch]: **Parallel voxel evaluation for `InverseDisplacementField`** —
  Per-voxel evaluation loop parallelized via moirai; reads shared immutable data
  (`src`, `dmat`, `amat`, `bvec`), returns per-voxel `[f64; 3]` tuple.
- [x] PERF-383-04 [patch]: **KMeans accumulator hoisting** —
  `sum`/`counts` vectors hoisted out of Lloyd iteration; reset with `fill(0)` each pass,
  eliminating `k × 2 × max_iterations` allocations per call.
- [x] PERF-383-05 [patch]: **SLIC `lo_cell`/`hi_cell`/`cell_coords` hoisting** —
  Three `vec![0usize; ndim]` allocations hoisted out of center loop in `build_grid_map`,
  eliminating `3 × n_centers × 2` allocations per SLIC iteration.
- [x] NEW-383-01 [minor]: **7 new cmake filter implementations** —
  `AntiAliasBinaryImageFilter`, `CannySegmentationLevelSet`, `ContourExtractor2DImageFilter`,
  `IsolatedWatershed`, `LevelSetMotionRegistration`, `PatchBasedDenoisingImageFilter`,
  `ScalarChanAndVeseDenseLevelSet` all implemented in Rust, wired to Python bindings,
  registered in respective modules, stubs added to `.pyi` files.

  in Sprint 382; baseline timings not yet recorded. Requires `cargo bench` on release build.
- [ ] NEW-383-02 [minor]: 3 cmake tests currently `skip` (AntiAliasBinary, CannySegmentationLevelSet,
  ContourExtractor2D) because the installed SimpleITK wheel doesn't expose these filters
  in the test environment. Tests are wired to the real implementations and will activate
  automatically when a compatible sitk wheel is installed.

## Sprint 382 — Deconvolution Crop Fix, cmake Coverage Expansion (Active)
**Target version**: 0.12.79
**Sprint phase**: Closure — all items delivered and verified

### Delivered (Sprint 382)
- [x] GAP-381-01 [patch]: **Deconvolution crop-position alignment** — `place_at_offset<D>` added
  to `helpers.rs`; `pad_and_fft` places image at offset `ker_dims[d]/2` per axis; `ifft_and_crop`
  reads from `coords[d] + crop_offset[d]` per axis. Matching ITK's `CropOutput` convention
  `(kernelSize[d]-1)/2 ≈ ker_dims[d]/2` for odd kernels. 907/907 Rust tests pass.
  New parity tests: Wiener Pearson=0.9982, Tikhonov Pearson=0.9982, Inverse Pearson≥0.80
  on 20³ step phantom blurred by 5³ Gaussian PSF. cmake total: 404/404. (Commits: cf38c4f1)
- [x] PERF-381-01 [patch]: **Criterion benchmarks for separable_box_3d and EDT Phase 3** —
  `benches/separable_box.rs` (GrayscaleDilation 128³ at r=2 and r=5) and
  `benches/euclidean_dt.rs` (DistanceTransformImageFilter 128³ checkerboard) added and
  registered in Cargo.toml. Both compile cleanly: `cargo build -p ritk-filter --benches` clean.
  Speedup baselines pending `cargo bench` run (TBD, not yet evidence-tiered). (Commits: cf38c4f1)
- [x] STUB-382-01 [patch]: **smoke: vector_confidence_connected_segment** — Added to
  segmentation required list in test_smoke.py; closes gap from parallel-agent commit f78197de.
  (Commits: cf38c4f1)

## Sprint 381 — Wiener Formula Fix, Parallel Box/EDT, cmake CoherenceEnhancingDiffusion
**Target version**: 0.12.78
**Sprint phase**: Closure — all items delivered and verified

### Delivered (Sprint 381)
- [x] FIX-381-01 [patch]: **WienerDeconvolution formula to match ITK exactly** —
  `WienerRule::apply_rule` changed from `pn/(|G|²−pn).max(1e-9)` to `pn/|G|².max(1e-20)`.
  Matches ITK's `snrSquared = |G|²/noiseVariance; denominator = |H|²+1/snrSquared`.
  Doc comments in `regularization.rs` and `wiener.rs` updated. 29/29 existing deconvolution
  tests pass; 0 clippy warnings. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] PERF-380-05 [patch]: **separable_box_3d moirai parallelism** — All three axis passes
  parallelized with `moirai::for_each_chunk_mut_enumerated_with`. X: z-slice chunks (ny rows
  each). Y: z-slice chunks (immutable buf_x read, write buf_y — disjoint allocs). Z: forward
  transpose [nz,ny,nx]→[ny·nx,nz] + parallel nz-column chunks + inverse transpose. Bit-identical
  output verified by 42 existing grayscale morph tests. Accelerates GrayscaleDilate/Erode,
  Opening/Closing, TopHat, H-transforms. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] PERF-380-04 [patch]: **euclidean_dt Phase 3 Z-column parallelism** — Transpose g2 to
  column-contiguous layout, parallel moirai over ny·nx Z-columns (each nz elements), scatter
  + sqrt in final iterator. 9/9 existing euclidean_dt tests pass; 0 clippy warnings. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] TEST-381-01 [patch]: **cmake parity: CoherenceEnhancingDiffusion (6 new tests)** —
  3 parametrized structural non-regression tests (synthetic slab image + Gaussian noise;
  invariants: finite, max_diff>3.0, std≤input·1.05, Pearson≥0.95) + 2 upstream-data
  non-regression tests (RA-Float.nrrd; finite, std not exploding) + 1 mean-conservation
  test (|mean_change|/|mean| < 1%). Closes CoherenceEnhancingDiffusion from the 17-filter
  uncovered list. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] STUB-381-01 [patch]: **smoke list: toboggan + vector_connected_component** —
  Added `toboggan` and `vector_connected_component` to segmentation smoke required list
  to catch gaps introduced by concurrent-agent commits 323554d4 and b9ca3275. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] DOC-381-01 [patch]: **Wiener test docstring correction** — Replaced stale
  'noise_to_signal (a ratio) vs noiseVariance (added to |H|²)' explanation with correct
  pipeline-scale-divergence diagnosis: ritk's `ifft_and_crop` crop-position produces
  output ~400–3000× larger than sitk's for band-limited input. Same root cause as
  InverseDeconvolution rel≈0.64 / Pearson 0.42–0.66. (Commits: b43afd4e)
- [x] FMT-381-01 [patch]: **cargo fmt --all** — Clean workspace-wide formatting.
  0 clippy warnings after fmt. (Commits: b43afd4e)

- [x] `uv run --no-sync pytest tests/ -m 'not slow and not registration'` → **814 passed,
  5 skipped** (scipy env gap is pre-existing — test_simpleitk_parity.py / test_vtk_parity.py
  / test_registration_validation.py excluded; in-scope tests all green)
- [x] `test_registered_functions_have_stub_and_smoke_coverage` → 1 passed (0 stub gaps)

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] GAP-381-01 [patch]: **Wiener/Inverse deconvolution crop-position scale divergence** —
  Root-cause identified (Sprint 381): `ifft_and_crop` crops from [0,0,0] of the padded
  IFFT output, yielding values ~400–3000× larger than sitk's for band-limited blurred
  input. ITK applies a different crop region (or different boundary condition). Fix requires
  careful analysis of ITK's `FFTConvolutionImageFilter::CropOutput` region computation;
  would close the Pearson≈0 divergence for WienerDeconvolution and improve
  InverseDeconvolution from Pearson≈0.42–0.66 to Pearson≥0.90.
- [ ] PERF-381-01 [patch]: **Verify separable_box_3d and EDT Phase 3 speedups with
  criterion benchmarks** — Both parallelizations are bit-identical to serial (verified by
  existing tests) but no benchmark baseline recorded yet for Phase 3 or separable_box_3d.
  Add benches/separable_box.rs before merging parallel claim.
- [ ] DOC-381-02 [patch]: 16 pre-existing intra-doc-link warnings (unresolved rustdoc
  links to private items). Non-blocking; target next sprint cleanup pass.

- [x] FIX-380-01 [patch]: **reinitialize_level_set + bitwise_not stubs** — Added
  `reinitialize_level_set` and `bitwise_not` stubs to `filter.pyi`; extended smoke
  required lists for filter (`reinitialize_level_set`, `bitwise_not`) and segmentation
  (`label_set_dilate`, `label_set_erode`, `merge_label_map`, `relabel_label_map`);
  closed stub/smoke gaps from concurrent-agent commits 59b19329 and 78521373.
- [x] PERF-380-01 [patch]: **euclidean_dt moirai parallelism** — Phases 1+2 of Meijster
  EDT parallelized over (iz·ny+iy) row-chunks (nx elements each) and iz z-slice-chunks
  (ny·nx elements each) via `moirai::for_each_chunk_mut_enumerated_with`. Per-thread
  scratch buffers; Phase 3 (Z-columns, non-contiguous in z-major layout) remains serial.
  Bit-identical output by construction. ~T× on phases 1+2 (~2/3 of serial work).
- [x] PERF-380-02 [patch]: **LabelDilation + LabelErosion moirai parallelism + clamp hoists**
  — Both `dilate_labels` / `erode_labels` inner serial loops replaced with moirai z-slice
  parallelism; stack-allocated `zz_buf`/`yy_buf` clamp-hoist (median_3d pattern). Bit-exact
  via brute-force reference tests. LabelOpening/LabelClosing double the speedup (two passes each).
- [x] PERF-380-03 [patch]: **FastChamferDistanceFilter const offsets** — `offsets()`
  function eliminated; replaced with `FWD_NEIGHBOURS` and `BWD_NEIGHBOURS` as
  `const &[(i64, i64, i64, f32)]` slices (13 entries each). Removes two `Vec` heap
  allocations on every `run()` invocation. Verified via existing chamfer tests.
- [x] TEST-380-01 [patch]: **cmake parity: SignedMaurerDistanceMap(isP=False)** — New test
  asserts Pearson ≥ 0.98 between ritk signed_distance_map and sitk.SignedMaurerDistanceMap
  (insideIsPositive=False), both negative-inside/positive-outside convention.
- [x] TEST-380-02 [patch]: **cmake parity: parametrized deconvolution tests** — 12 new
  test instances for Landweber (3), Wiener (3), Tikhonov (3), RichardsonLucy (3).
  Wiener and Tikhonov document known parameter-semantic divergence (noise_to_signal vs
  noiseVariance / lambda_ vs regularizationConstant).
- [x] TEST-380-03 [patch]: **ErodeObjectMorphology thread-safety fix** — Wraps sitk call
  in `SetGlobalDefaultNumberOfThreads(1)` to avoid ITK multi-threading data race (#4969).

### Deferred / carry-forward
- [ ] PERF-380-04 [patch]: **euclidean_dt Phase 3 parallelism** — Z-columns non-contiguous
  in z-major layout; requires transposed intermediate buffer. Deferred: phases 1+2
  already give ~2/3 of the serial savings; Phase 3 is the minor remainder.
- [ ] PERF-380-05 [patch]: **separable_box_3d moirai parallelism** — X/Y/Z passes each have
  embarrassingly parallel row/column structure; would accelerate all grayscale morphological
  filters (dilation, erosion, opening, closing, gradient, top-hat).
- [ ] GAP-380-01 [patch]: **Wiener deconvolution parameter-semantic investigation** —
  ritk `noise_to_signal` and sitk `noiseVariance` appear to parameterise the same filter
  with incompatible units; measured Pearson ≈ 0 across all test values. Needs root-cause
  analysis (see gap_audit.md).
- [ ] GAP-380-02 [patch]: **MinMaxCurvatureFlow ComputeThreshold divergence** — documented
  in SITK_CMAKE_EXCLUSIONS.md; test commented out until resolved.

- [x] DIAG-379-01 [patch]: **Root-cause stale-pyd** — `uv run pytest` resolves miniforge3
  `pytest` (no pytest in venv), loading the old miniforge3 `_ritk.pyd`. Fixed: sync `.pyd` +
  `__init__.py` to miniforge3 after `maturin develop --release`. Added `profile = "release"` to
  `[tool.maturin]` so future builds use release mode.
- [x] FIX-379-01 [patch]: **stub/smoke coverage** — Added stubs for `adaptive_histogram_equalization`,
  `approximate_signed_distance_map`, `normalized_correlation`, `masked_fft_normalized_correlation`
  to `filter.pyi`; extended smoke test required lists for filter (8 new) and segmentation
  (`multi_label_staple`).
- [x] FIX-379-02 [patch]: **signed_distance_map sign convention** — Updated
  `test_cmake_signed_distance_map_deviation_documented` to assert ritk's actual convention
  (negative-inside), Pearson ≤ −0.99 anti-correlation.
- [x] FIX-379-03 [patch]: **displacement field geometry mismatch** — Fixed
  `TestTransformToDisplacementFieldParity.test_transform_to_displacement_field_matches_sitk`
  by round-tripping through NRRD to align physical geometry (direction matrix) before comparing.

### Delivered (Sprint 378)
- [x] PERF-378-01 [patch]: **Parallelize BinaryContourImageFilter, VotingBinaryImageFilter, VotingBinaryHoleFillingImageFilter** over flat voxel index via `moirai::map_collect_index_with`. Commit: `ad8a1e40`

- [x] PERF-378-04 [patch]: **Parallelize erode_binary_3d, convolve_1d_axis, CED compute_gradient/gaussian_smooth/compute_divergence** — see below. Commit: `f8fe1970`
  - `morphology/binary_erode.rs`: `erode_binary_3d` uses flat-index parallel map with `.flat_map().all()` short-circuit
  - `edge/separable_gradient/mod.rs`: `convolve_1d_axis` (called 3× per gradient component × 3 axes = 9 calls per gradient)
  - `diffusion/coherence/pde.rs`: `compute_gradient`, `gaussian_smooth` (all 3 axes), `compute_divergence`
- [x] TEST-378-01 [patch]: **Fix deconvolution tests** — `SetOutputRegionModeToSame` replaced with correct API; InverseDeconvolution Pearson structural assertion; BoxMean/by333 + CurvatureFlow tolerance corrections; Canny structural parity test; GradientMagnitude/short + Median/radius2 cmake cases. Commits: `358cf656`, `d0c1254c`

### Known pre-existing failures (not introduced this session)

- `test_cmake_signed_distance_map_deviation_documented` — PyO3 ndarray type conversion issue

### Deferred / carry-forward

- [ ] FIX-transform_to_displacement_field — pre-existing world-axis ordering vs sitk convention
- [ ] FIX-signed_distance_map — PyO3 ndarray conversion for 4D input shape

### Known WIP in working tree — concurrent agent, do NOT touch

### Delivered (Sprint 377 — so far)
- [x] GATE [patch]: `morphology::window_1d` inline `#[allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)]` with justification (sliding-window genuinely needs index-based outer step)
- [x] REFACTOR [patch]: `segmentation::threshold::{huang,isodata,renyi}` `for i in 0..n { vec[i] }` → `for (i, &x) in slice.iter().enumerate()` / `for &x in slice` — idiomatic; value-semantic-equivalent.
- [x] FMT [patch]: `cargo fmt --check` clean on staged files
- [x] CLIPPY [patch]: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `de26c2fc refactor(segmentation,filter): needless_range_loop -> iterator`
- [x] PERF-377-01 [patch] (partial): **MedianFilter clamp-hoist micro-optimisation** — pre-baked Z-clamp & Y-clamp indices into stack buffers (`zz_buf`/`yy_buf`), eliminating `(2r+1)²` and `(2r+1)` redundant clamps per voxel; `radius==0` identity fast-path; `BUF_CAP=64` stack buffer with `2r+1<64` panic guard. Verified bit-identical to naive reference via two new brute-force equivalence tests (`to_bits()` equality at r=1 / r=3). Huang sliding-histogram full algorithm deferred (`concurrent_agents` and algorithmic scope note below).
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `c8048c5d perf(ritk-filter): hoist per-voxel clamps in MedianFilter`
- [x] PERF-377-02 [patch]: **BilateralFilter z-slice parallelism** — replaced serial `for iz in 0..nz` with `moirai::for_each_chunk_mut_enumerated_with` over disjoint output slices. Hoisted dz² + dy² outer-loop arithmetic; tightened spatial_w construction. Verified equivalent via existing brute-force reference test (max_abs < 1e-5). Bench: 32³ 152ms → 11.4ms (~13.3×); 16³ ~1.2ms; 64³ ~76ms (compute-bound linear scaling).
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `ca5b49a5 perf(ritk-filter): parallelise BilateralFilter over z-slices`
- [x] PERF-377-03 [patch]: **Rank/Percentile filter SSOT consolidation** — promoted duplicated `rank_select_3d` / `percentile_3d` algorithm bodies to a single canonical `rank::kernel::neighborhood_rank_3d`; both `RankFilter::apply` and `PercentileFilter::apply` now translate their public parameter to a `usize rank_idx` and delegate. Net: ~56 lines of duplicated API plumbing gone, one canonical site for future Huang / SIMD / sliding-histogram work. All 14 existing rank/percentile tests still pass; behaviour bit-equivalent.
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `cb671b64 refactor(ritk-filter): consolidate rank/percentile kernel to SSOT`
- [x] PERF-377-BENCH [patch]: **MedianFilter criterion benchmark** — new `crates/ritk-filter/benches/median.rs` with three sizes (16³, 32³, 64³) at r=2. Recorded baselines (release build, sample size 20-30): 197.47 µs / 1.4888 ms / 9.9397 ms. Captures the per-size threshold any future 3-D Huang sliding-histogram must beat before being accepted. Pattern matches `benches/bilateral.rs`.
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `47a0e794 perf(ritk-filter): add criterion bench for MedianFilter at r=2`
- [x] PERF-377-02-LUT-DOC [patch]: **Range-LUT ε-bound derivation** — module-level doc on `bilateral.rs` documents the analytical derivation showing a full quantised range LUT cannot meet the existing `1e-5` test tolerance (would require qscale > 728k bins/unit). Three honest alternatives enumerated (hybrid exp+LUT, loosen test tolerance, or keep current path) with their trade-offs; the parallelism-only implementation at `ca5b49a5` remains the final landing for PERF-377-02.
- [x] COMMIT [patch]: `462a6b63 docs(ritk-filter): record range-LUT epsilon-bound analysis on BilateralFilter`
- [x] PERF-377-FULL-DEFER [patch]: **Huang 3-D sliding-histogram MedianFilter** explicitly DOWN-SCOPED to a future backlog item. The 3-D Huang is estimated ~200 LOC of intricate bookkeeping; 2-D Huang is a regression (`O(r²·n_bins)` > current `O(r³)` for typical n_bins), and existing brute-force parallelism already meets 64³ = ~10 ms at r=2 (median bench baseline). Vote-with-feet: future work items may reopen if (a) a >10⁶-voxel workload appears, or (b) the algorithm is migrated into `rank::kernel::neighborhood_rank_3d` where it amortises across rank/percentile filters. PERF-377-01 partial (clamp-hoist) at `c8048c5d` and the median bench at `47a0e794` are the bounded Sprint 377 deliverable.

### Deferred / carry-forward (next increments)
- [ ] PERF-377-01-HUANG3D [patch→[minor]?] (deferred-with-rationale): **Huang 3-D sliding-histogram MedianFilter** — Perreault-Hebert 2007 §3.2 with `window_hist[n_bins]` + row_in/row_out column-histogram updates. Reopen condition: (a) >10⁶-voxel workload where the algorithm is the bottleneck, or (b) algorithm promotion into the `rank::kernel::neighborhood_rank_3d` SSOT to amortise across rank/percentile. Existing brute-force parallelism is already 10ms at 64³ r=2; 2-D Huang would be a regression (O(r²·n_bins) > current O(r³) at typical n_bins). See `benches/median.rs` for the per-size baseline threshold.
- [ ] PERF-377-02-RANGE-LUT [patch→[minor]?] (gate-blocked by test contract): **BilateralFilter range LUT** — module-level doc on `bilateral.rs` carries the ε-bound derivation; see commit `462a6b63`. A quantised `range_w[|dr|]` LUT over the full intensity range would need qscale > 728k bins/unit to hold the existing 1e-5 test epsilon for σ_r=50. Three options documented in code:
  1. Hybrid exp + LUT (≤ 2× at typical σ_r)
  2. Loosen test tolerance to a derived ~0.05 HU bound (test-contract change, [minor])
  3. Keep current `exp`-per-neighbour path (default)
  Reopen when (1) or (2) are justified by an explicit workload or test-contract change.
- [ ] DOC-377-01 [patch]: 16 pre-existing intra-doc-link warnings (rustdoc unresolved link, public docs → private items) accumulated from Sprint 393-395 commits; gated but non-blocking.
- [ ] FMT-377-01 [patch]: working-tree fmt-only diffs from cumulative agent updates (long-line rewraps). Now ~30 files per current `git status`; pure whitespace; next `cargo fmt --all` by next agent or this session will close.

### Known WIP in working tree — concurrent agent, do NOT touch

At session start (2026-06-17), the parallel agent has 22 files modified in working tree
(plus `rust_out.exe` deletion). Per `concurrent_agents`, treated as foreign WIP;
do not touch any of the below; coordinate via `git status` between commits:

- `crates/ritk-filter/src/color.rs` (whitespace-fmt)
- `crates/ritk-filter/src/morphology/{label_contour,label_morphology/reconstruction,regional_extrema,tests_grayscale_fillhole,tests_grayscale_grind_peak,tests_h_transform,tests_hit_or_miss,tests_reconstruction_opening_closing,tests_regional_extrema}.rs` — morphology feature/test batch
- `crates/ritk-filter/src/tests_color.rs`
- `crates/ritk-image/src/color.rs`
- `crates/ritk-python/pyproject.toml`, `src/segmentation/{labeling.rs,threshold.rs}`
- `crates/ritk-python/tests/{test_smoke.py,test_registration_gap_validation.py,test_registration_side_by_side.py,test_elastix_vs_ritk_rire.py}`
- `crates/ritk-registration/src/classical/global_mi/cma_mi/helpers.rs`, `src/metric/mutual_information/mod.rs`
- `crates/ritk-segmentation/src/threshold/{kittler.rs,mod.rs}`
- `rust_out.exe` (deleted build artifact)

Subsequent parallel-agent commits since session start:
- `271c026c feat(ritk-filter): add MedianProjection filter` (MedianIntensityProjectionFilter + Cargo.toml/version bump + lib.rs re-export — now landed in `271c026c`). `crates/ritk-filter/src/projection.rs`, `crates/ritk-filter/Cargo.toml`, `crates/ritk-filter/src/lib.rs` re-export, and `crates/ritk-python/{Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, _ritk/filter.pyi, src/filter/{mod.rs, projection.rs}}` land via this commit line.

`crates/ritk-filter/src/median.rs` is **clean** — this session's sole working file (`PERF-377-01 Huang sliding-histogram MedianFilter`).

## Sprint 376 — DRY Closure, Build Hardening & Carry-Forward Reconciliation
**Target version**: 0.70.1
**Sprint phase**: Closure — DRY closure, build hardening, fmt/clippy gating, CPR-PERF-01 all delivered and verified.

### Delivered (Sprint 376)
- [x] CARRY [patch]: Concurrent trunk of 25 inline test blocks extracted (`b052c40a refactor(filter): extract 25 inline test blocks to sibling files (SRP) [-3070L]`)
- [x] CARRY [patch]: Carry `cpro_CHRONO_history' DRY tracker commits `d4754aa1 6998b4cf d4a9a701 `carry-forward filter binding surface expansion (single-axis match sitk Euler3DTransform + extended corpus + API mismatches)`
- [x] CARRY [minor]: `feat(python): expose normalize, unsharp, zero-crossing, rotate, shift, zoom` (`43d9553 feat python filter bindings`) 6 new PyImage functions added.
- [x] CARRY [minor]: Concurrent drain: `feat(stats): Add ddof flag for sample (sitk) vs population std` + std-ddof population/sample parity tests
- [x] CARRY [patch]: Concurrent drain: `test(python): Connected-component + label-shape parity vs sitk`
- [x] CARRY [patch]: `chore(filter): enable ritk-image test-helpers feature for DRY helper consumption`
- [x] DRY-374-01 [minor]: `Refactor tests to use shared test_support helpers` — 78 test files migrated to delegating wrappers over `ritk_image::test_support::*`. Resolution: keeps thin local wrappers for type fixity while body delegates to canonical entry point.
- [x] CARRY [patch]: Cargo-fix applied 51 test files to strip unused `burn::tensor` and `ritk_spatial` imports after migration.
- [x] CLIPPY [patch]: 2 prior lint failures resolved before this sprint (doc list indent + Range single-element array). `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean at session start.
- [x] CLIPPY [patch]: 1 carry-over clippy warning fixed: `for i in 0..n { out[i] }`  closeness simplified to `for (i, &v) in out.iter().enumerate()` in `tests_hit_or_miss.rs`.
- [x] FMT [patch]: `cargo fmt --check` clean (0 diff lines).
- [x] FIX [patch]: Sister-file incorrect hit-or-miss assignment caught: line-48 `n` now unused after migration; clippy validates clean.
- [x] CONVERGED [patch]: Local tree in sync with `origin/main`.
- [x] BILAT-PERF-01 [minor]: `BilateralFilter::compute` rewritten with precomputed spatial-kernel lookup table `spatial_w[d²]` + clamped boundary iteration `z_lo..z_hi`. Per-neighbour cost reduced from 3 squarings + mul + `exp` to 1 lookup + 1 `exp`. Per-neighbour `as isize`/`as usize` casts and boundary branches eliminated. Verified bitwise identical vs brute-force reference (`max |Δ| = 0` on `5×6×7` deterministic volume).
- [x] BILAT-REGRESSION-01 [patch]: `test_bilateral_matches_brute_force_reference` added — locks the kernel computation to the original mathematical formulation by comparing `apply` output against an explicit-arithmetic reference on a non-trivial volume.
- [x] BILAT-BENCH-01 [patch]: criterion bench `benches/bilateral.rs` registered — measures `apply` over 16³/32³/64³ volumes at spatial σ = 1.5 (r ≈ 5). Baselines: 16³=14.4ms, 32³=152ms.
- [x] DOC-376-01 [patch]: `OPTIMIZATION.md` updated with Sprint 376 BilateralFilter section documenting LUT, clamped iteration, equivalence evidence and measured timings.
- [x] CPR-PERF-01 [patch]: `CprImageFilter::apply` rewritten with hoisted `direction.inverse()` (3×3 inverse computed once per call instead of once per cross-section sample) and a per-path-point index basis `(idx_p0, slope)` that collapses the inner loop to a linear-in-offset `idx_p[i,j] = idx_p0[i] + slope[i] * offset[j]`. New private helper `trilinear_sample_from_idx` accepts the precomputed voxel index; public `trilinear_sample` unchanged.
- [x] CPR-REGRESSION-01 [patch]: `cpr_apply_matches_brute_force_reference` + `cpr_apply_matches_brute_force_reference_nonidentity_direction` brute-force differential tests — locks value semantics against the pre-optimisation form (`max |Δ| ≤ 1e-5`) on both identity and non-identity direction matrices.
- [x] CPR-BENCH-01 [patch]: `benches/cpr_apply.rs` criterion bench — end-to-end `apply` on 16³/32³/64³ default config; head-to-head Δ vs reverted reference: 16³ 1.98×, 32³ 1.47×, 64³ 1.14×.

### Verification gate
- [x] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → 0 warnings
- [x] `cargo fmt --check` → 0 diffs
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-filter` → 707/707 passed (15 CPR tests; +2 vs prior 705 baseline from `cpr_apply_matches_brute_force_reference*` regression suite)
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-segmentation -p ritk-statistics -p ritk-tiff` → 707/707 passed
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-image -p ritk-statistics` → 312/312 passed
- [x] `cargo bench --bench bilateral` compiles and runs (16³=14.4ms, 32³=152ms; 64³ unmeasured)
- [x] `cargo bench --bench cpr_apply` compiles and runs: 16³=505µs, 32³=976µs, 64³=4.69ms (optimised); reference (reverted) 16³=1.00ms, 32³=1.43ms, 64³=5.33ms — speedup 1.98×/1.47×/1.14×
- [x] Numerical equivalence (CPR): `max |Δ| ≤ 1e-5` on 12³ identity + 10³ 90°-rotated direction matrices (regression tests locked)

## Sprint 373 — J2K interop closure (MQ root cause fixed)
**Target version**: 0.68.x  
**Sprint phase**: Closure — J2K-INTEROP P1 closed; next increment: SimpleITK parity comparison (tests + examples).

### Delivered
- [x] J2K-INTEROP [P1→closed, patch]: MQ probability-estimation root cause — `I(CX)` advanced on every MPS instead of only on renormalisation (ISO 15444-1 §C.2.6/Fig. C.7); encoder+decoder shared the defect so internal round-trips masked it. Found via register-trace diff against an instrumented vendored openjp2 (instrumentation removed after diagnosis). 6 interop acceptance tests un-ignored; escalation byte-compare green; `openjp2_captured_packet_conformance` (OpenJPEG 2.5.2 fixed vector) byte-exact both directions
- [x] Cleanup: diagnostic probe/dump tests removed; minimized impulse case kept as `cross_decode_impulse_8x8_regression`; env_logger/log dev-deps removed

### Delivered (cont. — SITK validation pass)
- [x] SITK-PARITY (filters/registration/statistics): `test_simpleitk_parity.py` 175/175 green against SimpleITK 3.0.0a1
- [x] J2K-BITSTUFF [P1→closed, patch]: tier-2 packet headers byte-stuffed (0x00 after 0xFF) instead of §B.10.1 bit-stuffing; found via SimpleITK/GDCM-written J2K DICOM failing to decode; `BitWriter`/`BitReader` rewritten on `opj_bio` semantics; 126-config interop matrices (incl. 12-bit) green both directions. ritk-codecs 0.5.2

- [x] SITK-PARITY (codec e2e, manual): SimpleITK/GDCM-written J2K DICOM → `ritk.io.read_image` exact at 8/12/16-bit (fresh wheel, extracted-archive run; 2026-06-12)

### Open (next increment)
- [ ] SITK-PARITY (codec e2e, automated): add the SimpleITK-written J2K DICOM round-trip as a pytest in `test_simpleitk_parity.py` once the concurrent agent's `fix/sitk-parity-mi-sampling` branch merges (file currently has uncommitted edits on that branch)
- [ ] J2K-LOSSY-97, JLS-INTEROP, CODEC-PERF, REG-MI-FLAKY: carry-forward

### Verification gate
- [x] nextest ritk-codecs → 194/194 (0 ignored); ritk-io → 330/330; clippy -p ritk-codecs --all-targets → 0 warnings; fmt clean; doc clean

## Sprint 372 — J2K conformance + interop harness (complete)
**Target version**: 0.68.x

- [x] J2K-372-HARNESS: openjp2 differential suite (dev-dep, pure Rust) — tier-2 header now parses OpenJPEG output exactly
- [x] JLS-NEAR-TAIL + JLS-16BIT-LOSSLESS [P1→closed]: single root cause — trailing 0xFF before EOI discarded as marker prefix; flush emits the stuffed follow byte. Proptests re-enabled at full domain

### Verification gate
- [x] clippy workspace -D warnings → 0; nextest codecs+dicom+io → 526/526 (9 ignored = tracked pending/defect tests)

## Sprint 371 — J2K multi-code-block tier-2 (J2K-MULTI-CBLK delivered)
**Target version**: 0.68.0 (ritk-codecs 0.5.0)  
**Sprint phase**: Closure — full-size single-tile J2K encode/decode delivered and verified.

### Delivered (Sprint 371)
- [x] J2K-371-TT [minor]: `tag_tree` module — §B.10.2 quad-tree with standard polarity, persistent cross-layer state; replaces the non-standard single-leaf coding
- [x] J2K-371-CBLK [minor]: 64×64 code-block partitioning per subband; per-band inclusion/MSB trees; per-code-block layer state; arbitrary single-tile sizes
- [x] J2K-371-TEST [patch]: multi-grid lossless round-trips (130×70 LL0; 150×100 L2 @16-bit); tag-tree unit + partial-threshold tests
- [x] J2K-371-BENCH [patch]: criterion 512×512 16-bit 5-level cases — encode 55.6 ms / decode 58.2 ms median (baseline `sprint371`); CODEC-PERF target ≈2–3× (OpenJPEG-class)

### Blocked / Deferred
- [ ] J2K-INTEROP [patch]: differential decode vs OpenJPEG-encoded reference corpus — now unblocked (conformant tag trees + multi-cblk in place); NEXT
- [ ] J2K-LOSSY-97, JLS-INTEROP, CODEC-PERF, REG-MI-FLAKY: carry-forward

### Verification gate (Sprint 371)
- [x] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → 0 warnings
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-codecs -p ritk-dicom -p ritk-io` → 526/526 (180 codec tests)

## Sprint 370 — J2K multi-level DWT (J2K-DECODE-DWT delivered)
**Target version**: 0.67.0 (ritk-codecs 0.4.0)  
**Sprint phase**: Closure — multi-resolution lossless J2K decode/encode delivered and verified.

### Delivered (Sprint 370)
- [x] J2K-370-DWT [minor]: forward + inverse multi-level 5/3 DWT on the Mallat layout (the prior multi-level ROI scheme was structurally wrong for N > 1); `subband` geometry module (rects, ZC orientations, gains)
- [x] J2K-370-T2 [minor]: LRCP multi-resolution packets with per-code-block state across layers; per-subband ε_b from QCD (`QcdMarker::exponents`); encoder emits 3N+1 SPqcd entries
- [x] J2K-370-FIX [patch]: tier-2 `BitReader::byte_pos()` returns RAW offsets — stuffed-0xFF packet headers desynced the next packet body (latent single-packet bug)
- [x] J2K-370-TEST [patch]: 2/3-level explicit round-trips, 2×2 L1 regression, proptest randomizes 0–3 levels; ritk-io DICOM round-trip uses 2 levels @16-bit
- [x] FIX-370-WS [patch]: in-flight registration example `registration_compare_figure.rs` write_nifti arg order

### Blocked / Deferred
- [ ] REG-MI-FLAKY [investigate]: carry-forward (in-flight registration wave)
- [ ] J2K-MULTI-CBLK, J2K-LOSSY-97, J2K-INTEROP, JLS-INTEROP, CODEC-PERF: carry-forward

### Verification gate (Sprint 370)

## Sprint 369 — Native JPEG-LS codec: CharLS elimination + NEAR support
**Target version**: 0.66.0 (ritk-codecs 0.3.0)  
**Sprint phase**: Closure — native JPEG-LS encoder/decoder delivered; zero C/C++ FFI in the DICOM codec stack.

### Delivered (Sprint 369)
- [x] JLS-369-ENC [minor]: pure-Rust JPEG-LS encoder (lossless + NEAR), mirror of the scan decoder over the shared context model; bit writer + Golomb writer with §C.2.1 stuffing
- [x] JLS-369-NEAR [minor]: NEAR-aware decode (TS .81 native); `CodingParams` + `quantize_error`/`reconstruct` SSOT shared by both sides
- [x] JLS-369-CONF [patch]: `default_thresholds` per ISO C.2.4.1.1.1 (4095 factor cap; >8-bit defaults were non-conformant); §A.3.3 NEAR dead-zone in gradient quantization
- [x] JLS-369-DEP [minor]: `charls` removed (workspace + dev-dep + build.rs libstdc++ hacks); registry `charls`/`openjp2` features and `jpeg2k` dropped — codec stack 100 % Rust
- [x] JLS-369-TEST [patch]: lossless + NEAR proptests, run-mode/interrupt fixtures, 12/16-bit threshold derivation tests; one-time differential: native NEAR=2 stream decoded by CharLS-backed backend before removal → |err| ≤ 2 confirmed
- [x] FIX-369-WS [patch]: clippy fixes in in-flight registration work (`grid.rs`, dead `integrate_geodesic_into` removed, bench rand API, `sample_count` call site)

### Blocked / Deferred
- [ ] REG-MI-FLAKY [investigate]: `translation_recovery_shifted_gaussian` fails deterministically (est 1.0 vs true 3.0) in the in-flight NGF/RSGD registration wave — owned by the concurrent registration effort; not in codec blast radius
- [ ] J2K-DECODE-DWT [minor]: carry-forward (Sprint 368)
- [ ] J2K-LOSSY-97, J2K-INTEROP: carry-forward (Sprint 368)

### Verification gate (Sprint 369)
- [x] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → 0 warnings
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-codecs -p ritk-dicom -p ritk-io` → 510/510 + 68 jpeg_ls module tests passed
- [x] `cargo doc --no-deps -p ritk-codecs` → warning-clean
- [x] libstdc++ DLL-shadowing failure mode eliminated (no C++ linkage remains)
- [x] criterion baseline `sprint369` saved (ritk-codecs/benches/codec_throughput): JPEG-LS 512x512 16-bit encode 13.4 ms / decode 10.3 ms (median); J2K 64x64 16-bit ~0.6 ms each way. Follow-up: CODEC-PERF profile-first optimization pass

**Target version**: 0.65.0 (ritk-codecs 0.2.0)  
**Sprint phase**: Closure — native J2K lossless codec delivered and verified.

### Delivered (Sprint 368)
- [x] J2K-368-MQ [patch]: MQ coder conformance fixes — INITDEC alignment, MPSEXCHANGE `A=Qe` removal, CODEMPS/CODELPS per Figures C.7/C.8, dummy-first-byte BYTEOUT, FLUSH `CT` shift, QE_TABLE NMPS/NLPS column swap, Table D.7 initial contexts
- [x] J2K-368-T2 [patch]: tier-2 packet fixes — Lblock terminator bit, Table B.4 39+ prefix (5 bits), inclusion tag-tree threshold 0
- [x] J2K-368-ENC [minor]: encoder promoted from `#[cfg(test)]` to public module (`jpeg_2000::encoder`); ritk-io consumes it for DICOM J2K round-trip tests
- [x] J2K-368-DEP [minor]: `jpeg2k`/`openjp2`/`openjpeg-sys`/`charls` removed from ritk-codecs; `decode_tile_part` params → `TileCodingParams`
- [x] J2K-368-TEST [patch]: 16-bit regression test + proptest lossless round-trip (random images, 8/12/16-bit, signed/unsigned)
- [x] FIX-368-REG [patch]: NGF/RSGD config call-site compile fixes (`center_weight_sigma_frac`, `learning_rate_decay`); `ngf_scalar` gated `#[cfg(test)]`

### Blocked / Deferred
- [ ] J2K-DECODE-DWT [minor]: multi-level 5/3 DWT decode (wavelet.rs idwt groundwork in place; `decode_tile_part` currently bails on `num_decomp_levels > 0`)
- [ ] J2K-LOSSY-97 [minor]: 9/7 irreversible wavelet (lossy TS .91 full support)
- [ ] J2K-INTEROP [patch]: differential decode test against an OpenJPEG-encoded reference codestream (real-world DICOM corpus)

### Verification gate (Sprint 368)
- [x] `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` → 0 warnings
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-codecs` → 145/145 passed (incl. 256-case proptest)
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p ritk-io` → 330/330 passed (JPEG2000 Windows abort resolved — pure-Rust path)

### Environment note
- `ritk-io` test binaries link `libstdc++-6.dll` (charls dev-dep); a Julia `libstdc++-6.dll` in PATH caused 0xc0000139 at load. Workaround: ucrt64 runtime DLLs copied beside `target/debug/deps`. Root fix: drop charls dev-dep once a pure-Rust JPEG-LS differential reference exists.

## Sprint 362 — Architecture Hardening: SSOT · DRY · SRP · DIP · Naming
**Target version**: 0.59.0
ritk-core: 0.9.0 → 0.10.0 | ritk-registration: 0.53.0 → 0.54.0 | ritk-segmentation: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0 | ritk-io: 0.2.0 → 0.3.0

### Track A — Correctness
- [x] FIX-362-01 [patch]: `engine.rs` fake-generic f32 hardcode → `loss.clone().into_scalar().elem::<f64>()` (fake-generic HARD violation; panics on non-f32 backends)
- [x] PERF-362-22 [patch]: Restore Moirai default features so RITK workspace consumers use default parallel execution, Mnemosyne memory surfaces, and Mellinoe branding; verification pending.

### Track B — SSOT Unblock
- [x] SSOT-362-02 [minor]: `ritk-io::ImageFormat` enum + `from_path` resolver; replace CLI `infer_format` and Python `io/mod.rs` if-chains
- [x] DRY-362-03 [patch]: Remove `FftDir` compatibility shim in `filter/fft/convolution/helpers.rs`; update all call sites to `ForwardFft`/`InverseFft` ZSTs

- [x] DRY-362-05 [patch]: `ConvergenceFlag` → `optimizer/regular_step_gd/convergence.rs`; re-exported through `regular_step_gd`, `optimizer::mod`; local private enums removed from `regular_step_gd/optimizer.rs` and `adaptive_stochastic_gd.rs`
- [x] DRY-362-06 [patch]: Complete `SamplingConfig` migration — replace `sampling_percentage: Option<f32>` in `MutualInformation` + `CorrelationRatio` + `compute_image/mod.rs`
- [x] DRY-362-07 [minor]: Rename `preprocessing::NormalizationMode` → `IntensityRescaleMode`; resolves name collision with `metric::NormalizationMode`
- [x] DRY-362-08 [patch]: `CacheSlot<T>` newtype + `MutualInformation` migration
- [x] SRP-362-09 [patch]: Split `bspline_ffd/basis.rs` (445L) → `basis/{scalar,cache,evaluate}.rs`
- [x] SRP-362-10 [patch]: Split `dl_registration_loss.rs` → `dl/losses/{lncc,grad,combined,mod}.rs`
- [x] SRP-362-11 [patch]: Extract `regularization/trait_::utils` → `regularization/spatial_ops.rs`; make `pub(crate)`
- [ ] PRIM-362-12 [minor]: `EarlyStoppingPolicy::Enabled { patience, min_improvement }` — bundle orphaned fields into enum variant
- [ ] DIP-362-13 [minor]: `Registration::with_config` DIP fix — `RegistrationCallbackSet` builder decouples engine from concrete callback types

### Track E — Segmentation
- [x] DRY-362-14 [minor]: `HistogramThreshold` sealed trait; blanket `compute<B,D>` + `apply<B,D>` for 6 threshold structs (~150L scaffold eliminated)
- [x] DRY-362-15 [patch]: `smooth_or_borrow(data, dims, sigma) -> Cow<[f64]>` in `level_set/helpers.rs`; collapse 3× repeated Cow conditional
- [x] PRIM-362-16 [patch]: `Connectivity { Six, TwentySix }` enum in `ConnectedComponentsFilter`; remove runtime `assert!`
- [x] SRP-362-17 [patch]: Extract `UnionFind` from `labeling/mod.rs` → `labeling/union_find.rs`

### Track F — IO
- [ ] SRP-362-18 [patch]: Split `dicom/seg/tests/convert.rs` (554L) → 4 test modules
- [ ] SRP-362-19 [patch]: Split `dicom/series.rs` → `series/{types,scan,loader}.rs`; replace `Arc<Mutex>` scan pattern with collect-and-merge

### Track G — CLI
- [ ] SRP-362-20 [major]: `FilterArgs` (46 fields) → `FilterKind` `ValueEnum` + `#[command(flatten)]` per-family structs; `SegmentArgs` same treatment
- [x] DRY-362-21 [patch]: `Backend` alias duplicated in `commands/mod.rs` + `commands/viewer.rs`; viewer uses `super::Backend`
- [x] DRY-362-22 [patch]: `scales: String`, `cpr_points: Vec<String>` deferred parsing → `value_delimiter` typed fields

### Track H — Naming Violations
- [ ] NAMING-362-23 [patch]: `transform_1d/_2d/_3d/_4d` in `bspline/interpolation/` → `transform_points_impl` dispatching on `D` — BLOCKED: duplicate method names on same type across impl blocks; requires [arch] refactor
- [ ] NAMING-362-24 [patch]: `spatial_gradient_2d/_3d`, `spatial_laplacian_2d/_3d` → move to `deformable_field_ops/`, surface only through `dispatch.rs`

### Track I — Primitives
- [ ] PRIM-362-25 [minor]: `IntensityRange { min, max }` validating newtype; adopt in `MinMaxNormalizer.target_{min,max}` and `ZScore` params
- [x] PRIM-362-26 [patch]: Add `// PRECISION:` justification comment in `normalize.rs` f64 accumulator path
- [ ] PRIM-362-27 [minor]: `DicomSeriesInfo` — replace `ArrayString<64>` public fields with `&str` accessor; keep `ArrayString` internal

### Track J — DIP/Arch
- [x] DIP-362-28 [patch]: `wgpu_compat` → `pub(crate)`; file `[arch]` `ExecutionPolicy::max_batch_size()` item
- [x] ARCH-362-29 — Filed [arch] backlog item: `Image<B,T,D>` scalar phantom `PhantomData<T>` — dtype safety, f32 hardcoded throughout; requires architectural migration

- [x] `cargo clippy -p ritk-registration --all-targets -- -D warnings` → 0 warnings
- [x] `cargo test -p ritk-registration --lib` → all green
